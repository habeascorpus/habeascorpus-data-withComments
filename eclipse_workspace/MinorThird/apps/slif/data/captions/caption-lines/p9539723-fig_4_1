F IG . 3 . Dependence of subtilisin dige stion on v inblastine c oncentration. Tubulin (2 mg y ml) was preincubated w ith dif ferent c oncentrations of v inblastine at 25C for 25 min followed by subtilisin (1:100) dige stion for 50 min. Af ter addition of 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl f luoride, sample s were electrophore sed on SDS y 10% gels. ( Top ) Coomassie st ain. ( Middle ) Fraction of tubulin as native or dige sted monomers. ( Bottom ) Comparison of turbidit y ( E ) and 90 light scattering ( F ) under the same c onditions.
