Figure 4. Immunogold double labeling of endomannosidase and glucosidase II in ultrathin frozen sections of clone 9 cells. Immunolabeling for glucosidase II (large gold particles, some marked by arrows) extends through the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum and is also observed in the intermediate compartment, but not in the Golgi apparatus (G). Endomannosidase (small gold particles, arrowheads) and glucosidase II immunolabeling are both present in the intermediate compartment and a grazing section through it is shown in B. In the Golgi apparatus, only small gold particles (arrowheads) are present. Bars, 100 nm. Immunolocalization of Endomannosidase Vol. 11, December 2000 4233
