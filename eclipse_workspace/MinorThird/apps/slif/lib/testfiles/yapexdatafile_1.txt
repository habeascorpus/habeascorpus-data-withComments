<ArticleTitle>Molecular dissection of the <Protname>importin beta1</Protname>-recognized nuclear targeting signal of <Protname>parathyroid hormone-related protein</Protname>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Produced by various types of solid tumors, <Protname>parathyroid hormone-related protein</Protname> (<Protname>PTHrP</Protname>) is the causative agent of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The similarity of <Protname>PTHrP's</Protname> amino-terminus to that of <Protname>parathyroid hormone</Protname> enables it to share some of the latter's signalling properties, but its carboxy-terminus confers distinct functions including a role in the nucleus/nucleolus in reducing apoptosis and enhancing cell proliferation. <Protname>PTHrP</Protname> nuclear import occurs via a novel <Protname>importin beta1</Protname>-mediated pathway. The present study uses several different direct binding assays to map the interaction of <Protname>PTHrP</Protname> with <Protname>importin beta</Protname> using a series of alanine mutated <Protname>PTHrP</Protname> peptides and truncated human <Protname>importin beta1</Protname> derivatives. Our results indicate that <Protname>PTHrP</Protname> amino acids 83-93 (KTPGKKKKGK) are absolutely essential for <Protname>importin beta1</Protname> recognition with residues 71-82 (TNKVETYKEQPL) additionally required for high affinity binding; residues 380-643 of <Protname>importin beta1</Protname> are required for the interaction. Binding of <Protname>importin beta1</Protname> to <Protname>PTHrP</Protname> is reduced in the presence of the GTP-bound but not GDP-bound form of the guanine nucleotide binding protein <Protname>Ran</Protname>, consistent with the idea that <Protname>Ran</Protname>GTP binding to <Protname>importin beta</Protname> is involved in the release of <Protname>PTHrP</Protname> into the nucleus following translocation across the nuclear envelope. This study represents the first detailed examination of a modular, non-arginine-rich <Protname>importin beta1</Protname>-recognized nuclear targeting signal.
