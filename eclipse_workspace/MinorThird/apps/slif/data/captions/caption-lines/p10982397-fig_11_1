Figure 5. tER clusters form even when Golgi structures reemerge from the ER. NRK cells were incubated with 5 m g/ml BFA for 1 h ; this treatment caused the complete redistribution of giantin into the ER. Nocodazole was then added to 5 m g/ml, and after 30 min the BFA was washed out in the continued presence of nocodazole. Sec13 and giantin were visualized as in Figure 4. (A) Fifteen minutes after BFA removal, small giantin-containing structures are associated with nearly all of the tER sites. (B) Two hours after BFA removal, large giantin-containing structures are associated with clustered tER sites, but many of the individual tER sites lack adjacent giantin staining. Scale bars represent 10 m m. (C) Quantitation of the localization data, as described in Materials and Methods. The graph shows the percentage of the Sec13 staining that is within 0.3 m m  of a giantin-containing structure at various times after BFA washout in the presence of nocodazole. The bar on the right gives the corresponding value for NRK cells that were treated with nocodazole alone for 2 h . SDs are indicated. Transitional ER Dynamics Vol. 11, September 2000 3023
