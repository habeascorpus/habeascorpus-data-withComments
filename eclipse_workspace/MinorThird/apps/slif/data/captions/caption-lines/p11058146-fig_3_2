Fig. 3. Two V motifs of N-WASP VCA are required for its full activity. ( A ) Schematic structures of N-WASP MV1, MV2, and MVD VCAs. ( B ) The effect of mutation in V motif on actin polymerization. Actin polymerization was followed in the presence of MV1, MV2, or MVD VCAs (100 nM). ( C ) The ability of MV1, MV2, and MVD VCAs to bind G-actin and Arp2 y 3 complex. MV1, MV2, and MVD VCAs were immobilized on beads and incubated with G-actin or Arp2 y 3 complex. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Yamaguchi et al .
