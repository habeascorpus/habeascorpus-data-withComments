paper0005-figures/figure0005-captionContent.txt Representation of the unified role of PARP in the Reg gene transcription and DNA repair. #x03B2 cells are affected by many agents such as immunological abnormalities, virus infections, irradiation, and chemical substances (1, 14#x201318), leading to local inflammation in and#x002For around pancreatic islets. (1) Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and glucocorticoids are produced in the inflammation process. IL-6#x002Fglucocorticoid stimulation induces the formation of an active transcriptional complex for Reg, a #x03B2-cell regenerating factor gene, in which PARP is involved, and when the PARP is not poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in the presence of PARP inhibitors, the transcriptional complex is stabilized and the Reg gene transcription is maintained. Reg protein then produced in #x03B2 cells acts as an autocrine#x002Fparacrine growth factor on #x03B2 cells via the Reg receptor. DNA replication in #x03B2 cells thus occurs, and the #x03B2-cell regeneration is achieved. (2) DNA-damaging substances such as superoxide (O#x00B72) and nitric oxide (NO#x00B7) are frequently produced in inflammatory processes. When the DNA is damaged, PARP senses DNA nicks and autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ates itself for the DNA repair. Once PARP is autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ated, the formation of the Reg gene transcriptional complex is inhibited, interfering with the interaction between PARP and other nuclear proteins necessary for the active complex; therefore, the transcription of Reg gene stops. (3) When DNA is massively damaged, PARP is rapidly activated to repair the DNA (1, 9#x201313), and the complex for Reg gene transcription is not formed at all.

paper0022-figures/figure0005-captionContent.txt Model of ICRACL conformational coupling to IP3R and modulation by PIP2. ICRACL-IP3R and ICRACL-IP3R-PIP2 complexes exist in equilibrium in resting cells (Left). Background ICRACL channel activity in cell-attached patches in resting cells results from endogenous IP3 (40#x2013100 nM) (31) activating ICRACL-IP3R complexes. Exposure of patches excised from the resting cells to 2.5 #x03BCM IP3 leads to elevated ICRACL channel activity in i#x002Fo configuration (Right). Exposure to UTP in the pipette triggers cleavage of IP3R-tethered PIP2 and direct activation of ICRACL-IP3R-PIP2 complexes in cell-attached patches as previously proposed (17). The shift from ICRACL-IP3R-PIP2 to ICRACL-IP3R complexes (Top) explains high activity of ICRACL channels in i#x002Fo patches in the presence of 2.5 #x03BCM IP3 (Top Right). Exposure to Tg in the pipette or to BAPTA-AM#x002FTg in the bath causes depletion of local Ca2#x002B stores and activation of ICRACL channels by means of conformational coupling mechanism (30). Depletion of Ca2#x002B stores by some unknown mechanism promotes formation of ICRACL-IP3R-PIP2 complexes (Bottom), which leads to the loss of ICRACL sensitivity to activation by 2.5 #x03BCM IP3 in excised patches (Bottom Right). Despite loss of sensitivity to activation by IP3, ICRACL channels in ICRACL-IP3R-PIP2 complexes remain active as long as stores are depleted and ICRACL inactivation is prevented by chelating Ca2#x002B with BAPTA. The model drawing is adapted from ref. 47.

paper0036-figures/figure0001-captionContent.txt Presenilin-dependent activity of Notch in the embryonic central nervous system. Neuroblasts marked by the expression of Hb protein are shown in wild-type (A, C, and E) and PS#x2212 (B, D, and F) embryos that ubiquitously express either N#x002B (A and B), NECN (C and D), or Nintra (E and F) under Gal4#x002FUAS control. (A) Ubiquitous expression of N#x002B in otherwise wild-type embryos has little or no effect on neuroblast segregation. (C and E) In contrast, ubiquitous expression of either NECN or Nintra suppresses neuroblast segregations, indicating constitutive transducing activity. In PS#x2212 embryos, most or all ventral ectodermal cells segregate as neuroblasts, even when N#x002B or NECN are ubiquitously expressed (B and D), indicating that the transducing activity of these transmembrane forms requires Presenilin. In contrast, neuroblast segregation is suppressed in PS#x2212 embryos expressing Nintra (F), indicating that this form of Notch bypasses the requirement for Presenilin. All embryos are shown in ventral aspect just after completion of germ-band elongation (anterior to the left). The structure of the Notch proteins are shown schematically: EGF, epidermal growth factor motifs; LNR, LIN-12#x002FNotch repeat motifs; TM, transmembrane domain; CDC10, CDC10#x002FSWI6 motifs.
paper0036-figures/figure0002-captionContent.txt Presenilin is required for the transducing activity of transmembrane but not intracellular forms of Notch during wing development. Each column contains views of a single mosaic imaginal wing disk. Clones that lack PS activity are marked by GFP expression (green). These clones also express either NECN or Nintra, which are constitutively active in a wild-type genetic background. smc-Z expression (red) labels SMCs that will form mechanosensory bristles in the presumptive notum (n) as well as sense organs in other portions of the disk. Cut expression (blue) marks subsets of SMCs. Cut is also expressed in a thin stripe of #x201Cedge cell#x201D straddling the dorsoventral compartment boundary (vd) in the wing blade, and in adepithelial cells associated with the notum. The disk shown in A contains only a single small clone and hence serves as a reference for the normal disk. Disks are shown anterior to the left and ventral down. (A) Series of views of a disk carrying one small clone of PS#x2212UAS-NECN-expressing cells (yellow arrow). Cells within the clone form a cluster of SMCs (marked by smc-Z and Cut expression) instead of the single SMC that would normally form at this position, indicating the absence of Notch transducing activity. Single SMCs (marked by smc-Z expression) in neighboring wild-type tissue are indicated by arrowheads. (B) This disk carries multiple PS#x2212 clones that express NECN and display phenotypes associated with the absence of Notch transducing activity. Two clones in the notum (yellow arrows) show the formation of SMC clusters in place of single SMCs; two clones in the wing blade span the dorsoventral compartment boundary (white arrow and arrowhead) and show a cell autonomous loss of Cut expression. (C) This disk serves as a control. Clones of PS#x2212UAS-NECN-expressing cells were generated in the presence of a rescuing Tub-PS#x002B transgene. Restoration of Presenilin activity from the rescuing transgene reveals the constitutive activity of NECN within clones. In the notum, SMCs do not form, indicating that neurogenesis is suppressed. There is no overlap between the clone (green) and smc-Z expression (red); the few apparent cases are due to superimposition of the nuclear GFP and cytoplasmic smc-Z signals in different focal planes. In the wing blade, clones autonomously express Cut, indicating constitutive activity of Notch (white arrow marks a representative clone). These clones are also associated with overgrowth of neighboring, wild-type tissue, an indication that the mutant cells are ectopically expressing Wg as well as Cut. (D) This disk carries several clones of PS#x2212UAS-Nintra-expressing cells. Clones in the wing blade autonomously express Cut. The wing blade clone marked by the white arrow has also induced neighboring wild-type cells to express the smc-Z reporter, an indication that these cells are developing as wing margin bristles in response to Wg ectopically expressed by the mutant cells within the clone (see also Fig. 3C).
paper0036-figures/figure0003-captionContent.txt Adult wing phenotypes associated with PS#x2212 clones that express transmembrane or nuclear forms of Notch. Clones are marked by expression of Yellow under UAS#x002FGal4 control, which darkens cuticular structures, including wing hairs and margin bristles (not visible in the figure). (A) PS#x2212 clones that express NECN display phenotypes associated with the absence of Notch signal transduction. One clone (#x002A) crosses the wing margin (which coincides with the dorsoventral compartment boundary) and displays extensive wing notching. A second clone (arrowhead) within the dorsal compartment of the blade forms an abnormally thick vein. (B) A clone of PS#x2212 cells that express NECN in the presence of the rescuing Tub-PS#x002B transgene displays constitutive Notch activity (arrow). The clone is associated with a double dorsal wing outgrowth which is flanked by adjacent rows of dorsal wing margin bristles (here, as in C, an arrow points down the plane of mirror symmetry). Note that in this experiment, the presence of the clone could not be scored on the margin bristles because the Tub-PS#x002B transgene used in this experiment includes a yellow#x002B gene which rescues normal (dark) pigmentation in the bristles. However, the contribution of the clone to the rest of the wing blade could still be scored because this yellow#x002B gene does not rescue pigmentation of the wing hairs. (C) A clone of Nintra-expressing PS#x2212 cells (arrow) associated with a double dorsal wing outgrowth which coincides with a thin strip of mutant cells flanked by adjacent rows of dorsal wing margin bristles formed by neighboring wild-type cells.

paper0073-figures/figure0001-captionContent.txt The cell cycle Grand Prix and effects of opposing repair strategies in different environments. Team I (green) always stops for repairs when a problem is indicated, whereas team II (red) ignores all warning lights. Team I wins under ordinary conditions (A) because it always has a faultless vehicle, whereas team II accumulates errors. In the harsher environment (B) the vehicles accumulate damages more quickly than can be repaired, and team I gets trapped in the checkpoint. Team II, on the other hand, jerks along in its faulty vehicle with a fair chance of making the finish line. This simple assessment of repair strategies thereby provides an explanation for the paradox that mutagenic environments favor repair deficiency.
paper0073-figures/figure0002-captionContent.txt Mutagenic selection of genetic instability. Bardelli et al. (3) started out with the genetically stable cell line H3 (HCT 116 artificially complemented with chromosome 3). This cell line was first exposed to selection pressure involving cytotoxic levels of PhIP. The selected cells expressed CIN, illustrated as a trisomy and a translocation. The same cell line (H3) then was exposed to selection pressure involving cytotoxic levels of MNNG (N-methyl-N#x2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanine). This time the selected cells expressed MIN, illustrated as slippage in a repetitive sequence. The experiment thus supports the hypothesis that the CIN and MIN phenotypes reflect Darwinian adaptations to different mutagenic environments, methylating and BAF agents, respectively.
paper0084-figures/figure0003-captionContent.txt Numerical solutions of evolutionary change in a weedy species growing in a spatially implicit habitat in which fitness is limited both by dispersal ability and by competitive ability, based on a model of phenotypic diffusion (36). (A) Given this trade-off, an initially weedy species, species 1, undergoes evolutionary change, with its peak shown moving to the right. (B) After 50,000 years, species 1 has evolved into a much better competitor, but a much poorer disperser than it originally was, and a new species, species 2, has appeared. Species 2 is a superior disperser, but an inferior competitor. It survives in vacant sites in this spatial habitat. (C) Species 1 and 2 each evolve toward being superior competitors. After some time a third species appears that is a poor competitor, but excellent disperser. This third species evolves into a superior competitor and a fourth species appears, etc. Shown here is the result after 475,000 years, at which time 21 peaks of abundance appear, each peak representing a different phenotype, thus corresponding with different species.
paper0087-figures/figure0001-captionContent.txt A map of site irreplaceability for the CFR. Areas (planning units comprising 1#x002F16#x00B0 cells) where existing reserves cover >50#x0025 of the area are regarded as mandatory reserves. Totally irreplaceable units include areas of habitat that are essential to meet reservation targets, whereas units where irreplaceability is zero comprise habitat for which reservation targets have been achieved. The analysis, driven by explicit reservation targets for 88 Broad Habitat Units (BHUs), and mapped at 1:250,000 (56), was undertaken by using C-PLAN, a decision support system linked to a geographic information system (53).
paper0095-figures/figure0001-captionContent.txt A comparison of the sensitivity of several assays. (A) IDAT assay in which lysates (1 mg#x002Fml) from T6#x201317 or NR6 (p185her2/neu negative) cells were diluted as indicated and captured by the anti-p185her2/neu Ab 1E1. The ds-oligo-conjugated mAb 4D5 was used to detect the antigen and perform the amplification assay. Although we detected a positive band in T6#x201319 cells at 10#x221213 dilution, no positive band was noticeable in the control NR6 cells at 10#x22123 dilution. It should be noted that this type of RNA amplification can lead to smaller-sized signals because of premature T7 termination and RNA degradation. Such smaller-sized signals are apparent in some figures. (B) A conventional sandwich ELISA assay with 1E1 and 4D5 was performed on cell lysates. An anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed) was used as the secondary Ab. Results from NR6 cell lysates also were included to show the baseline of the ELISA assay. The ELISA assay detects p185her2/neu readily only at 10#x22124, 10#x22123, 10#x22122, 10#x22121, and 100 dilutions. (C) Western blot assay. T6#x201317 cell lysate (lane 1, 10 #x03BCl; lane 2, 1 #x03BCl; lane 3, 0.1 #x03BCl, equal to 10#x22121, 10#x22122, and 10#x22123 dilutions, respectively, as in A and B) were loaded for 6#x0025 PAGE. A polyclonal anti-p185her2/neu Ab NEU from Santa Cruz (200 #x03BCg#x002Fml) was used for Western blot at 1:2,000 dilution.
paper0095-figures/figure0002-captionContent.txt Lysates from different cell lines (1 mg#x002Fml) were diluted as indicated and captured by the anti-rat p185neu Ab A11 or the anti-human p185her2/neu Ab 1E1. The ds-oligo-conjugated mAb 7.16.4, single-chain 7.16.4ScFv, or the CDR3 peptide AHNP were used to detect the antigen and perform the amplification assay.
paper0095-figures/figure0003-captionContent.txt Lysates from different cell lines (1 mg#x002Fml) were diluted as indicated, and receptors were captured by the anti-rat p185neu Ab A11 or the anti-human p185her2/neu Ab 1E1. The 7.16.4ScFv and pY99 (a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine) were used to probe the rat p185neu or the phosphorylated proteins, followed by the detection with the ds-oligo-conjugated anti-polyHis tag Ab or the anti-IgG2b subtype Ab, respectively. Although the p185her2/neu is constitutively phosphorylated in T6#x201317 cells, it is transactivated in A431 cells only after EGF stimulation. EGF stimulates heteromer formation of EGFR and p185her2/neu, which forms an active kinase complex.
