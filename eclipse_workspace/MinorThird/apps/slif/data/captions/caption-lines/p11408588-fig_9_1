Figure 6. Cholesterol extraction af fects the integrity of GIC. Isolated CHO Golgi membranes (1.4 mg; A), CHO total membrane fraction (2.5 mg; B), or intact CHO cells that overexpress the folate receptor (B and C) were incubated for 30 min at 37C in the absence or presence of 20 mM methylb-cyclodextrin (CD). The detergent-soluble (S) and detergent-insoluble (L for low density) were isolated from these incubations as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS. The fractions were analyzed for the presence of proteins as indicated in the panels by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. In case cholesterol was added back to the incubation (a, CD 1 ), 450 m g of cholesterol (solubilized in ethyl alcohol (10 mg/ml, freshly prepared) was added after solubilization of the Golgi membrane fraction in PEN plus 1% Triton X-100 (final ethyl alcohol concentration of 2.5%) and incubated for another 30 min at 0C before loading on the gradient.
