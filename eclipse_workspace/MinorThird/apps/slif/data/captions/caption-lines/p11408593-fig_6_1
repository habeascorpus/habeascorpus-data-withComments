Figure 3. Deletion of the AP-1 b subunit gene in combination with gga2 D strongly af fects a-factor maturation. Wild-type (WT, SEY6210; lane 1), apl2 D gga2 D (GPY2420-3C; lane 2), apl1 D gga2 D (GPY2422-9D; lane 3), apl6 D gga2 D (GPY2425-29C; lane 4), and apl4 D gga2 D (GPY2426-38C; lane 5) cells were processed and quantified as described in the legend to Figure 1.
