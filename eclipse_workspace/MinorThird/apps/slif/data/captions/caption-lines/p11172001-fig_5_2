Fig. 6. Immunocomplexes from double transfectants efficiently convert GM3 to GM1. Truncated Gal-T2 affects the efficiency of conversion. To assess for the two-step conversion of GM3 to GM1, immunocomplexes from double (GalNAc-T y Gal-T2) or triple (GalNAc-T y Gal-T2 y Gal-T2 1-52 ) transfectants or from mixtures of immunoprecipitates from single transfectants, as indicated, were incubated in a final volume of 20 m l with 100 m M UDP-GalNAc, 10 m M UDP-[ 3 H]Gal (1 3 10 6 cpm), 20 mM MnCl 2 , 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, 3 m M CDP-Choline, 20 m g Triton CF-54 y Tween 80 (2:1, wt/wt) for 2 h at 37C in the presence or absence of 400 m M GM3 (see Fig. 1 A ). Reaction products were processed for lipid-bound radioactivity determination and HPTLC as indicated (4). Results are the mean 6 SD of three independent experiments. ( Inset ). [ 3 H]GM1 was identified as the main radioactive product of incubates with immunocomplexes of double (lane 1) or triple (lane 2) transfectants, after HPTLC of the lipid extracts and phosphorimaging. Lane 3 shows the positions of cochromatographed radioactive glycolipid standards obtained from clone 3 metabolically labeled from [ 3 H]Gal. Giraudo et al.
