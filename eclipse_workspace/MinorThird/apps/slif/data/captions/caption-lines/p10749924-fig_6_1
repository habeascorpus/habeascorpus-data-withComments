Figure 2. Nuclear migration dynamics of diploid cnm67 D cells. Mitotic cell cycles were observed by in vivo time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear positioning of the preanaphase nucleus to the bud neck is usually similar to wild type (e.g., 0 9 , cell A). Unlike in wild type, spindle elongation during anaphase is mostly restricted to the mother cell (e.g., 18 9 , cell A). Elongation of the anaphase spindle usually occurs along the mother-bud axis (e.g., 18 9 , cell A) and is normally followed by a successful nuclear movement into the bud (e.g., 27 9 and 42 9 , cell A). In case of spindle misalignment (192 9 , cell A), the subsequent nuclear migration often fails (201 9-345 9 , cell A) leading to a binucleate cell with an anucleate bud. Nuclear divisions in binucleated cells occur simultaneously (354 9 , cell A, and 498 9 , cell B). After successful transit of a nucleus into the bud, separation can be observed by a change of the position of the bud relative to the mother cell during cytokinesis (e.g., 42 9 and 63 9 , cell A). Anucleate buds (marked with asterisks) are not separated from the mother cell (cell A from 300 9 and cell B from 360 9 ). Bar, 10 m m.
