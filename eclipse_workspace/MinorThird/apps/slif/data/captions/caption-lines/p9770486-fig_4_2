F IG .3 . ( A-C ) Subnuclear localization of the nuclear transcripts derived f rom the active VSG ES. T. br ucei variant 221a cells hybridized w ith probe mix 4 (see Fig. 1 A ) and the ribosomal probe R2. Cells were treated w ith DNase before hybridization. ( A ) Detection of probe mix 4 (Fig. 1 A and Mater ials and Methods ) w ith FITC-c onjugated antibodie s. The single intense spot, in the nucleus, shows the localization of the nascent transcripts derived f rom the active site. The more dif fuse st ain ing in the c y toplasm c orre sponds to ES mRNAs. ( B ) Simult aneous detection of the active ES RNA (g reen) and the nucleolus (red). Overlap bet ween the t w o signals appears in yellow. ( C ) Detection of the ribosomal probe R2 ( Mater ials and Methods ), w ith Texas Redc onjugated antibodie s. The circle in the nucleus shows the signal derived f rom the nuclear rRNA, for ming the nucleolus (together w ith the rDNA and the proce ssing machiner y). The c y toplasmic signal c ome s f rom the rRNA in ribosome s. ( D-H ) Subnuclear localization of marker gene s integ rated in the active VSG ES in the 3174 transfor mant of T. br ucei variant 221a (ref. 36; Fig. 1 B ). ( D ) Detection of probe neo 1 hyg (active VSG ES) w ith FITC-c onjugated antibodie s. The probe hybridized to the marker gene s appears as a small f luore scent signal in the nucleus; a c y toplasmic signal attribut able to mRNA is also v isible. ( E ) Simult aneous detection of the active ES (g reen) and the rDNA in the nucleolus (red). The overlap of signals appears as yellow (or slightly orange). ( F ) Detection of the signal derived f rom the ribosomal probe R2. ( G and H ) Simult aneous detection of the active ES (g reen) and the rDNA (red) in RNase-treated cells; H also shows the DA PI-st ained nucleus). Cell Biolog y: Chave s et al . P roc. Natl . Acad .
