Fig. 2. Accumulation of PS y APP-CTF complexes after inactivation of g-secretase in stably transfected cells. ( a ) Lysates from PS WT (lanes 5-8) and aspmutant (lanes 1-4) stable transfectants were coimmunoprecipitated (IP) with either PS1 antibodies (X81, 4627, or R22) or preimmune serum (pre), as indicated, followed by Western blotting (WB) with APP antibody 13G8. The APP species that coprecipitated with both WT and asp-mutant PS1 comigrated with the N-glycosylated form of APP detected on straight Western blots of the lysates (lanes 9-11). The lower band in lanes 2-4 and 6-8 is nonspecific. ( b ) Cell lysates were coimmunoprecipitated with PS1 antibodies (combined X81 and 4627, lanes 1, 3, and 5), PS2 antibody 2972 (lane 7), or preimmune serum (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Precipitates were probed by Western blotting with APP antibody 13G8. The C83 and C99 that coprecipitate with PS1 and PS2 are only a small fraction of the C99 and C83 detected by straight Western blotting (WB) of 1 y 20th the amount of the respective cell lysates with 13G8 (lanes 9-11). ( c ) Structure of the difluoro ketone peptidomimetic g-secretase inhibitors, compounds 1 and 11. ( d ) Lysates from WT PS1 cells treated with vehicle alone (DMSO) or the reported g-secretase inhibitor Cpd 11 for 8 h r were coimmunoprecipitated with PS1 antibody R22 (lanes 3 and 5) or preimmune serum (lanes 2 and 4). Precipitates were probed by Western blotting (WB) with APP antibody C7 to detect C83. Small amounts of C99 (which is substantially less abundant than C83) also can be coprecipitated with PS1, but this is very difficult to visualize photographically. Lane 1 shows a straight C7 Western blot of a D257A PS1 cell lysate to indicate the gel positions of C83 and C99. Xia et al . PNAS u August 1, 2000 u vol. 97 u no. 16 u 9301 NEUROBIOLOGY
