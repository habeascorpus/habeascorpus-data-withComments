Figure 4. Actin dependence of Ain1p and Fim1p localization. Cells expressing Ain1p-GFP (strain JW46; A-D) or Fim1p-GFP (strain JW109; E and F) were treated with 100 m M Lat-A (added from a stock solution in DMSO; see MATERIALS AND METHODS) (A and C-F) or an equal volume of DMSO alone (B) at 25C for 20 min, and then stained for actin (A and B) or examined for the GFP-fusion proteins (C and E) after staining with Calcofluor and bisBenzimide to allow visualization of septa and DNA in the same cells (D and F). Bar, 10 m m.
