Required:
 - view a textbase/textlabels only - TextBaseEditor with read-only zoom window.
 - view/edit a text/textlabels - TextBaseEditor with std zoom window
 - test a mixup program on fixed ground truth - TextBaseEditor with read-only zoom window
 plus extra pane to load/refresh a mixup program (program is stored off-line)

Plan:
 - read-only option for zoom window -DONE
 - option for nested labels and mixup program
 
 - Implement a 'layered' SeqLabels using an array of SeqLabel's; earlier ones will shadow the later ones (DONE)
 - Implement a TestEditor which creates a simple seqBase and simple labels for testing. (DONE - main in SeqBaseEditor)
 - Split into SeqBaseEditor, and MixupDebugger.
 - SeqBaseEditor lets you 
 -- view a selected type of spans; -done
 -- view differences between two types of spans, Guess and Truth  -done 
 -- see a birds-eye view (or zoom in and out by changing font sizes)
 -- optionally, zoom into a particular document -done
 -- optimally, edit the documents from the main list and/or from the zoomed-in document
    to edit, one can delete/add Truth spans, move from Guess to Truth [+ - < > a z] 
 -- might also want a concept of completely labeled areas (vs unlabeled documents) ???

 - MixupDebugger additionally lets you edit a program and see the results as 'guess'
with a SeqBaseEditor.

Issues:
 - should this all be in edu.cmu.minorthird.wcohen ? YES
 - should overlapping Seq's be ok? NO
 - how to avoid re-creating JTextPanes?
 - should SeqBase be a ListModel for a JList? this might be more efficient
