Fig. 1. Interaction between the two a-helices in the tropomyosin coiled-coil. Each a-helix is shown with seven residues ( a-g )  in two turns. ( A ) End-on view looking from N terminus. The interface between the a-helices derives primarily from hydrophobic residues in core positions a and d , although there are also some salt bridges formed between residues e and g .( B ) The core interface viewed parallel to the coiled-coil axis shows how residues from one chain occupy the spaces between the corresponding residues from the second chain to give ``knobs in holes'' packing (18). In tropomyosin there are slightly more than 3.6 residues per turn, which produces a left-handed supercoil. www.pnas.org y cgi y doi y 10.1073 y pnas.151265198 PNAS u July 17, 2001 u vol. 98 u no. 15 u 8165-8166 COMMENTARY
