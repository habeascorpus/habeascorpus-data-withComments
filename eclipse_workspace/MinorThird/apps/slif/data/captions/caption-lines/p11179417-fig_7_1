Figure 4. Deletion of NET2 suppresses fragmentation of mitochondria seen in fzo1 D cells but does not prevent loss of mitochondrial DNA in fzo1 D cells. (A) fzo1 D net2 D cells contain normal, tubular mitochondria. Wild-type (BY4742) and fzo1 D strain RJ1232 , net2 D strain RJ1253 , and fzo1 D net2 D strain RJ1286, all expressing OM45pGFP from pKC2, were grown to mid log phase and viewed by DIC and fluorescence fluor.) microscopy. Representative images of cells are shown. Bar, 5 m m. (B) Deletion of NET2 in fzo1 D cells does not suppress the loss of mtDNA in fzo1 D cells. NET2/net2 D fzo1 D /FZO1 (strain RJ1295) cells were sporulated, and a representative tetratype is depicted growing on medium containing either dextrose (YEPD) or glycerol plus ethanol (YEPGE) as the carbon source.
