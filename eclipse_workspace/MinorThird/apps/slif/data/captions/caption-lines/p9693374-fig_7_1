Figure 6. Three-dimensional organization of microtubules in the puf f. A cell injected with TAMRA-tubulin was fixed at a stage similar to that shown in Figure 5H. The cell was optically sectioned and deconvolved, and microtubules visible in each section were traced using Corel Draw. The traces were then reconstructed into a stereo pair. Many microtubules in the puf f originate near the central region of the spindle and project toward the cortex. They appear to be independent of astral or kinetochore microtubules but merge with astral microtubules near the lateral margins. Bar, 10 m m. Cytokinesis in NRK Cells Vol. 9, August 1998 2179
