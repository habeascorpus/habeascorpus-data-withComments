Fig. 2. Pulse-chase experiment showing the time course of mShh autoprocessing and turnover of precursor and mature forms of mShh in normal and sterol-deprived cells. CHO-7 cells, where indicated stably expressing mShh, were grown overnight in medium A. One hour before metabolic labeling, t he medium was replaced, as indicated, with sterol-depriving medium. Cells were labeled for 30 min with 35 S-labeled Met followed by a variable-length chase (see Materials and Methods ). Recombinant mShh was immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates of cell pellets with mouse a-FLAG(M2) z agarose and subjected to SDS y PAGE (12% gel).
