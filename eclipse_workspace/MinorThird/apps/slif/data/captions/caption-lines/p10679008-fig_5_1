Figure 2. Localization of endogenous dynamin by immunogold labeling of ultracryosections. The localization of endogenous dynamin in HeLa dynK44A cells grown in the presence of tetracycline was determined by labeling of ultracryosections with the hudy-1 antibody (5-nm gold). Dynamin is localized to clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface (large arrowheads in A) and to the TGN adjacent to a Golgi stack (GO in B), where the membrane network characteristic of the TGN is outlined by arrowheads. Moreover, dynamin is localized to endosomes (EN) that contain internalized 20-nm cationized gold particles (large arrowheads in C) and CI-MPR (10-nm gold; large arrowheads in D-F). Note that dynamin (small arrowheads in C-F) is localized mainly to tubulo-vesicular extensions of the endosomes. Bar in A, 100 nm; bars in B-F, 200 nm.
