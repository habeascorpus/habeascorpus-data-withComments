 - learn classifiers for imageptr's,  -done
				     
 - caption processing: given a string s
 -- load classifiers for imageptr's, reconstruct annotators
 -- find imgptr's with annotators
 -- compute local/regional scopes with mixup code, ensure at
 most one local/regional imgptr is in each local/regional scope
 -- find cells with mixup code
 -- load proteins with importOps
 -- for each cell, protein span s
      for each local/regional scope span t containing s
          find local/regional imgptr u for scope span t
	  associate t and u
	  associate u and s

tasks:
 - write mixup code to compute scope (as a function of a span) -done
 - write code to annotate a caption
