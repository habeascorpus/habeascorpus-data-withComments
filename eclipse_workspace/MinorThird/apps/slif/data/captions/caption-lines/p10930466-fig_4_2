Figure 5. Movie 5. Z-series analysis of subnuclear structures; these structures are physically distinct. Bar, 35 m m. The three-dimensional reconstruction in B was assembled from the corresponding confocal Z-stack with the use of Data Explorer running on an SGI Onyx2 workstation. The contour wireframe images were created with the use of a two-dimensional contour algorithm to identify the nuclear peripheries on each slice of the stack, then composited together into a three-dimensional stack of contours. We acknowledge the assistance of Marvin Landis (University of Arizona Center for Computing and Information Technology) in producing the reconstruction. E. Chytilova et al.
