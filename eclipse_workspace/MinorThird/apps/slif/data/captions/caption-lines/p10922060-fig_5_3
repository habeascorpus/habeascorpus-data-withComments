Fig. 5. Interaction of the C terminus of AF-6 and profilin. ( Top ) Two-hybrid interaction. An isolated profilin I cDNA containing an additional leader sequence and PCR-amplified profilin I and profilin II cDNAs fused to GAD were cotransformed with LBD AF-6N into L40 and were assessed for b-galactosidase expression and for their ability to grow on medium lacking histidine. pLexLamin and pGADGH were used as negative controls. ( Middle ) Structure of AF-6. ( Bottom ) AF-6 -profilin association examined in GST pull-down assays. Overlapping fragments of the AF-6 C-terminal 700 amino acids were expressed as GST fusions and used to bind profilin from a whole-cell MDCK lysate. Bound profilin was visualized with an a-profilin Ab in a subsequent Western blot analysis. 9068 u www.pnas.org Boettner et al .
