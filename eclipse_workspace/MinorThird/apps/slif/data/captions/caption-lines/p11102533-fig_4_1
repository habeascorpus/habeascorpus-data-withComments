Figure 2. Size fractionation of the purified GSTBet3p fraction. The purified GST-Bet3 fraction (750 m l, 3 m g protein) was applied to a Superdex 200 gel-filtration column. Fractions (0.3 ml) were collected and assayed as follows: (a) Stimulation of GTP uptake by Ypt1p. As described in Figure 1b, 12.5 m l of column fractions were assayed, but reaction volume was 25 m l; 30-min time points are shown. (b) Western-blot analysis of GST-Bet3p. Analyses by SDS-PAGE of 7.5 m l  of column fractions were followed by western blotting, using anti-GST antibody. (b) Stimulation of GTP uptake by Ypt32p. Column fractions were assayed as described in (a) using Ypt32p as a substrate; 60-min time points are shown. The position of the molecular weight markers are shown as diamonds at the top of panel a (from the left: Vo, Blue dextran, 2 3 10 3 kDa; thyroglobin 670 kDa; aldolase 158 kDa). The results represent two independent experiments. S. Jones et al., Molecular Biology of the Cell 4406
