F IG . 1 . Coimmunoprecipit ations and af fin it y chromatog raphy using mAbs (No-63 and No-185) against nucleolar protein NO38 of X. laevis .( A ) Autoradiog raph of immunoprecipit ate s obt ained w ith mAb No-63 (lane 2) or mAb No-185 (lane 4) f rom extracts of [ 35 S]methion ine-labeled A6 cells, prepared in lysis buf fer c ont ain ing 250 mM NaCl and separated by SDS y PAGE. Both mAbs c oprecipit ated, be side s protein NO38 (denoted by a triangle), a g roup of low molecular weight proteins ( M r # 29,000). By c ontrast, proteins of higher molecular weight ( M r $ 45,000) pre sent in such immunoprecipit ate s were bound unspecifically to protein G-Sepharose (lane s 1 and 3). ( B-E ) Autoradiog raphs of immunoprecipit ate s obt ained w ith mAb No-63 f rom cellular extracts ( B-D ) and extracted nuclear LSP ( E ) of [ 35 S]methion ine-labeled A6 cells, analyzed by 2D gel electrophore sis (first dimension: NEPHGE). The position of nucleolar protein NO38 is indicated by a triangle. ( B ) A nalysis of the immunoprecipit ate s shown in A (lane 2) disclosed the acidic as well as basic nature of the low molecular weight proteins c oprecipit ated w ith protein NO38. ( C and D ) Basic proteins were removed partially at higher ion ic strength (400 mM NaCl; C ) and c ompletely by treatment of the immunoprecipit ate s w ith high-salt buf fer ( D , PBS plus 1 M NaCl). By c ontrast, the acidic proteins remained in the immunoprecipit ate s. ( E ) A f ter immunoprecipit ation of proteins extracted f rom LSP f ractions of isolated A6 nuclei w ith buf fer c ont ain ing 400 mM NaCl, only the acidic proteins c oprecipit ated whereas basic proteins were not detect able. ( F ) Coomassie blue-st ained proteins obt ained by preparative af fin it y chromatog raphy (mAb No-185) f rom unlabeled cellular extract, prepared as in A , a f ter 2D gel electrophore sis (first dimension: IEF). The position of nucleolar protein NO38 is indicated by a triangle. The bracket marks IgG light chains leached f rom the No-185 antibody c olumn. The large st and most acidic of the c o-precipit ating proteins, denoted by an arrow in B-E , was re solved into t w o closely mig rating polypeptide s  of M r 24,000 and 23,000 (pI ' 4.3), marked by t w o arrows in F . Arrows in the upper c orners in B-F indicate the directions of electrophore sis (first dimension, NEPHGE or IEF, horizont al arrow; sec ond dimension, SDS y PAGE, vertical arrow). Basic proteins are in the right-hand part of each protein separation. Horizont al bars indicate reference proteins of 205, 116, 97.4, 66, 45, and 29 kDa (f rom top to bottom). 11388 Cell Biolog y: Zir we s et al . P roc. Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 (1997)
