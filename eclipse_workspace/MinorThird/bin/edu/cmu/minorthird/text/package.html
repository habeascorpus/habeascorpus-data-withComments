    Storing and manipulating annotated text.

    <h2>Basic Concepts In this Package</h2>
    
    <p>
    A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextToken} is a "token" (usually a single word in a
    document), plus some additional information that allows one to
    find out where this word/token occured. Specifically one can
    recover the string that contained the token, a shorter string
    <em>identifier</em> of this "document" string, and the character
    offsets of the token--i.e., where it appeared in the document
    string.

    <p>A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.Span} is a sequence of adjacent TextTokens from the
    same document.

    <p>Spans and TextTokens are considered to be inheritantly ordered.
    If two Spans or TextTokens are from different document, they are
    ordered lexigraphically based on the <em>identifiers</em> of those
    documents.  Within a single document, TextTokens are according
    to their position in their document, and Spans are ordered
    according to their leftmost TextToken (using the rightmost
    TextToken to break ties.)

    <p>A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextBase} is a collection of tokenized "document"
    strings, accessible as Spans.

    <p>A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextLabels} contains <em>markup</em> for
    a {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextBase}.  This markup can consist of
      <ul>
      <li>String-valued properties of individual TextTokens (i.e.,
      individual occurances in the TextBase of words.)  
      <li>String-valued properties of Spans of TextTokens in the
      TextBase.
      <li>Groupings of Spans into "types".  A Span can belong to
	multiple types, and unlike properties, it is possible to
	quickly find all Spans of a given type in a TextLabels, or
	find all Spans of a given type in a specific document.
      </ul>
    There are a couple of different varieties of TextLabels's.  An {@link
    edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextLabels} can only be read, not modified.
    A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.MonotonicTextLabels} can be modified by
    changing attribute values, adding new attribute values, or adding
    Spans to a type; however, Spans cannot be removed from a type.  A
    plain old {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.TextLabels} allows spans to be
    removed from a type as well (ie is mutable).

    <h2>Annotators and AnnotatorLoaders</h2>

    <p>Markup in a TextLabels object is usually provided by an {@link
    edu.cmu.minorthird.text.Annotator}.  A sort of subroutine-calling
    mechanism for Annotators is provided by the
    <code>textLabels.require</code> call, the
    <code>textLabels.isAnnotatedBy</code> call, and the {@link
    edu.cmu.minorthird.text.AnnotatorLoader} mechanism.  If one
    Annotator relies on the output of another---for instance, an NP
    chunker requires POS tags---it should use the
    <code>textLabels.require</code> method to make sure that the
    annotation is present. <code>textLabels.require</code> then uses
    an AnnotatorLoader to find an Annotator that will produce the
    required annotation type, using the
    <code>annotatorLoader.findAnnotator</code> method.  Annotators
    record the fact that they have been run on a textLabels object by
    using the <code>textLabels.setAnnotatedBy(...)</code> method;
    this ensures that annotations are not run more than once.

    <p>Taken together these mechanisms provide something in between a
    programming language for annotations, and a simple planner for
    constructing annotations.  As a planner, each Annotator
    corresponds to an operator: its preconditions are specified by
    calls to "require", and its postconditions are specified by calls
    to "setAnnotatedBy" (or in mixup, by "provide" statements.)  The
    AnnotatorLoader corresponds to a backwards-chaining planner, and
    its decisions about what Annotator to use are how the plan is
    constructed.

    <p>However, the AnnotatorLoader don't do anything fancy to find
    Annotators: in response to a "require" call for label "foo", the
    AnnotatorLoader looks for a file "foo.mixup" or a Java class names
    "foo", in that order.  So the default behavior is simple enough
    that it looks more like a programming language, with the
    AnnotatorLoader being just a binding mechanism.  

    <p>There are several ways the binding mechanism can be modified.
    <ol>
      <li>In the <code>require</code> call, one can specify a filename
      in addition to a desired label type (in mixup, this is the
      second argument to the "require" call).  This causes this
      filename to be used instead of the the default "foo.mixup" or
      Java class "foo".  

      <li>In the <code>annotators.config</code> file, (usually located
      in minorthird/config), one can specify default filenames for a
      set of label types "foo".  These will be used instead of
      "foo.mixup", unless some other filename is specified.

      <li>The rules above rely on low-level routines to find files
      (like mixup files) and find Java classes.  In the {@link
      edu.cmu.minorthird.text.DefaultAnnotatorLoader}, this is done
      using the system ClassLoader.  One can also specify a
      non-default AnnotatorLoader in a call to <code>require</code>,
      which uses different rules to find files.  

      <p>The main use of this mechanisms is the {@link
      edu.cmu.minorthird.text.EncapsulatingAnnotatorLoader}, which
      contains a cache of files and/or Java classes that it will use in 
      preference to anything on the classpath.  This is useful
      if you want to bundle a bunch of Annotators along with
      a classifier or extractor that uses them.
    </ol>

    <p>Currently, AnnotatorLoaders are <strong>not</strong> used for
    loading Mixup resources like dictionary files, only for loading
    Annotators.

    <h2>NestedTextLabels</h2>

    <p>A {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.NestedTextLabels} is an odd
    sort of implementation of a MonotonicTextLabels. It combines two
    TextLabels's, an "inner" one and an "outer" one, such that the
    outer one can be monotonically added to, but the inner one is
    never modified.  Semantically, the markup in a NestedTextLabels is
    the union of the markup in the inner and outer TextLabels's,
    except that property values in the outer TextLabels "shadow"
    values in the inner TextLabels.

      This has several possible uses, for instance:
      <ol>
      <li>One can add change a TextLabels and then "back out" the changes
      by (a) creating NestedTextLabels with an empty "outer"
      MonotonicTextLabels, (b) monotonically adding to this new "outer"
      TextLabels, and then (c) discarding the NestedTextLabels and reverting
      to the old "inner" TextLabels to undo the modifications.

      <li>One can easily construct and view the union of two TextLabels's
      (or at least, some well-defined approximation of this), which
      still being able to modify either underlying TextLabels.  For
      instance, one can construct a single TextLabels which contains the
      output of a {@link edu.cmu.minorthird.text.mixup.MixupProgram}, plus some hand-labeled
      "ground truth" data, while still being able to re-run the
      program and get new output and/or edit the "ground truth".
      </ol>
