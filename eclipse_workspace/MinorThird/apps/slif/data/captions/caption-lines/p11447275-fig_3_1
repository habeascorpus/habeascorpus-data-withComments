Fig. 2. Localization of actin filaments at different stages of heterocellular collisions between IAR-2 epitheliocytes and RAT-1 fibroblasts. ( A ) Before contact, the epithelial cells (ep) within an island exhibit typical marginal bundles (arrowheads) at their free edge, whereas fibroblasts have numerous bundl es of filaments extending radially into a broad lamella. ( B ) Early stage of heterocellular collision, where the fibroblast has migrated beneath the edge of an epithelial island. Notice the localized disassembly of the marginal bundle in the area of collision and coincident formation of radially oriented small bundles of actin filaments within a small lamellipodial extension at the edge of the epithelial cell (see arrow). ( C )  At later stages of collision fibroblasts retracted the underlapped lamella and turned away from the epithelial edge. The marginal bundles within epithelial cells remain disassembled, and small, actin-rich lamellipodia (ar row) continue to retain contact with the surface of the turned fibroblast. ( D ) When grown in dense cultures numerous fibroblasts align themselves so that their side edge runs along the edge of epithelial islands. Epithelial cells form numerous lamellipodial extensions out onto the surface of the fibroblast (arrows), and th e characteristic marginal bundles are completely disassembled.
