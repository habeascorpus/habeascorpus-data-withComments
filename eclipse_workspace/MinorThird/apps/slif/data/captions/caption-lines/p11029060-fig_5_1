Figure 1. Mutation of methionine-43 to alanine in Snc1 yields a thermosensitive exocytic v-SNARE. (A) SNC1 ala43 encodes a thermosensitive v-SNARE. Left panel: snc cells (SP1 background-JG8 and W303 background-JG10) transformed with a control vector ( snc )  or plasmids constitutively expressing SNC1 or SNC1 ala43 were patched onto synthetic complete plates containing galactose. Cells were grown  for 3d at 26C, before replica plating onto medium containing glucose to deplete SNC1 . After 24 h, patches were replica plated onto the following: galactose- (GAL) and glucose-containing (GLU) plates at 26C; prewarmed glucose-containing plates at 35C and 37C; and amino acid-rich medium (YPD). Plates were incubated for 30 h. Right panel: snc cells (JG8) transformed with a control vector ( snc ), or plasmids expressing SNC1 or SNC1 ala43 , were grown to log phase on galactose-containing medium and then were shifted to glucose-containing medium for 24 h t o deplete SNC1 . Cells were seeded in fresh glucose-containing medium at 26C, and optical density (measured at 600 nm) was monitored as a function of time. (B) Invertase secretion is blocked in SNC1 ala43 cells after a shift to restrictive temperatures. Wild-type (SP1), snc (JG8), and snc cells (JG8) transformed with plasmids expressing SNC1 or SNC1 ala43 were grown to log phase on galactose-containing medium, shifted to glucose medium for 24 h  at 26C and then derepressed for 2 h  on low glucose (0.05%) medium at either 26C or 37C. Both secreted (black) and nonsecreted (gray) invertase activities were measured. (C) SNC1 ala43 cells accumulate secretory vesicles at restrictive temperatures. snc cells (JG8) expressing a control vector ( snc ), SNC1 , or SNC1 ala43 were grown to log phase on glucose-containing medium. Cells were maintained at 26C, or were shifted  for 2ht o 37C (indicated as 37C), and were processed for electron microscopy. Bar indicates 1 m m. (D) Localization of Snc1GFP and Snc1 ala43-GFP in sec6 cells. sec6-4 cells transformed with plasmids expressing Snc1-GFP or Snc1 ala43-GFP were maintained at 26C or were shifted  for 2ht o 37C, and then were processed for confocal microscopy.
