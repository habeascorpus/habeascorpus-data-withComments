Fig. 2. AP-1 and AP-2 inhibit TIP47 association when bound to the membrane-proximal portion of the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain. ( A ) Immunoblot analysis of clathrin-adaptor binding to GST-CI-MPR constructs confirms the recognition of tyrosine and y or dileucine motifs by AP-1 and AP-2. ( Left ) AP-1 (detected with antig adaptin). ( Right ) AP-2 (detected with antia adaptin). ( B ) The amount of TIP47 binding to the CI-MPR cytoplasmic domain is shown for several mutations, in the presence or absence of AP-1 or AP-2, as indicated. Error bars represent standard deviations. ( C ) Summary diagram. Occupation of the membrane-proximal YYV motif by either AP-1 or AP-2 inhibits TIP47 binding, but binding of AP-1 to the membrane-distal dileucine does not. Shaded bars represent residues 48-75.
