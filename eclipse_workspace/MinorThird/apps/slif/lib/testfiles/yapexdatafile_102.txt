<ArticleTitle>Interaction of <Protname>p130</Protname> with, and consequent inhibition of, the catalytic subunit of <Protname>protein phosphatase 1alpha</Protname>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The <Protname>protein p130</Protname> was originally isolated from rat brain as an <Protname>inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein</Protname> with a domain organization similar to that of <Protname>phospholipase C-delta1</Protname> but which lacks <Protname>phospholipase C</Protname> activity. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library for clones that encode proteins that interact with <Protname>p130</Protname> has now led to the identification of the catalytic subunit of <Protname>protein phosphatase 1alpha</Protname> (<Protname>PP1calpha</Protname>) as a <Protname>p130-binding protein</Protname>. The association between <Protname>p130</Protname> and <Protname>PP1calpha</Protname> was also confirmed in vitro by an overlay assay, a "pull-down" assay, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. The interaction of <Protname>p130</Protname> with <Protname>PP1calpha</Protname> resulted in inhibition of the catalytic activity of the latter in a <Protname>p130</Protname> concentration-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of COS-1 cells that stably express <Protname>p130</Protname> and of mouse brain extract with antibodies to <Protname>p130</Protname> and to <Protname>PP1calpha</Protname> also detected the presence of a complex of <Protname>p130</Protname> and <Protname>PP1calpha</Protname>. The activity of <Protname>glycogen phosphorylase</Protname>, which is negatively regulated by dephosphorylation by <Protname>PP1calpha</Protname>, was higher in COS-1 cells that stably express <Protname>p130</Protname> than in control COS-1 cells. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca(2+) signaling, <Protname>p130</Protname> might also contribute to regulation of protein dephosphorylation through its interaction with <Protname>PP1calpha</Protname>.</AbstractText>
