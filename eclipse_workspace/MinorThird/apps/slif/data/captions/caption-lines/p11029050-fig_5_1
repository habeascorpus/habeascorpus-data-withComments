Figure 4. Vimentin alone targets SNAP23. Confocal sections of human fibroblasts showing redistribution of SNAP23 following acrylamide-induced vimentin disruption. SNAP23 immunoreactivity redistributes in large vimentin-positive structures and is found at the plasma membrane. Arrows point to plasma membrane localization of SNAP23.
