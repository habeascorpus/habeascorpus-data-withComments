Fig. 2. Subcellular fractionation of microsomes from HepG2 cells. Microsomal proteins (1.7 mg) from HepG2 cells were fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. Proteins from the 0.6 y 0.25, 0.85 y 0.6, and 1.15 y 0.85 interfaces were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and separated by SDS y PAGE, followed by Western blotting using anti-BIG1 or anti-BIG2 IgG or antib-COP antibodies, as indicated. Observations were replicated three times. Yamaji et al. PNAS u March 14, 2000 u vol. 97 u no. 6 u 2569 CELL BIOLOGY
