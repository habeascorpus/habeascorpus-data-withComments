Fig. 3. Detection of epixenosomes on E. arenarium .( a ) Detail on ejected extrusive processes in phase contrast superimposed with the green signal of epixenosome specific probe. The heads of ejected epixenosomes are clearly labeled. ( b and c ) Double hybridization with the Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probe Eare-832-Cy3 specific for Euplotidium (red signal), and with the fluorescein-labeled polynucleotide probe specific for epixenosomes (green signal). Both organisms are specifically labeled. The green fluorescence is visible only at the level of the epixenosomal band or on the heads of ejected tubes. ( d and e ) Corresponding phase contrast of b and c . (Bars 5 10 m m.) 1816 u www.pnas.org Petroni et al.
