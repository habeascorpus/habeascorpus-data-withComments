Fig. 3. The behavior of retrovirally transduced HUVEC in vivo . Histology of ( a ) Bcl-2and ( b ) EGFP-transduced HUVEC constructs harvested 31 days after implantation into a SCID y beige mouse ( 3 1,000). UEA-1 staining (brown) of the constructs in a ( c ) and b ( d )( 3 200). ( e ) Anti-Bcl-2 staining (brown) of a Bcl-2-transduced construct 31 days after implantation into a SCID y beige mouse ( 3 1,000). ( f ) Fluorescence of the EGFP-transduced HUVEC constructs in vivo ( 3 400). ( g ) Anti-murine CD31 staining (red) of a Bcl-2-transduced HUVEC construct in vivo , showing the restriction of mouse microvessels to the edge of the construct (arrow, 3 400). 9194 u www.pnas.org Schechner et al.
