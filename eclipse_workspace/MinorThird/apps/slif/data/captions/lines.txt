The kinesin head (K394) was incubated with MTs in the absence or presence of IAA-HeLa Glu or IAA-HeLa Tyr tubulin (A), a-tubulin fragments (B; a-C, a-N, and a-C Glu), or C-terminal peptides of a-tubulin (B), was pelleted by centrifugation, and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Pellet and supernatant (Spt) fractions are shown in A, whereas only pellet fractions are shown in B. Bands marked T and K are tubulin and the kinesin head K394, respectively. Note, in A, that little kinesin head is detected in the MT pellet in the sample incubated with IAA-HeLa Glu tubulin (kinesin head is instead recovered in the supernatant), but significant kinesin head is recovered in MT pellets in the sample incubated with IAA-HeLa Tyr tubulin. The additional tubulin recovered in the supernatants in the IAA-HeLa Glu and Tyr tubulin samples reflects the added nonpolymerizable tubulin. Con, control. G. Kreitzer et al .

(A) T lymphoblasts plated on ICAM-1-Fc-coated plastic dishes were allowed to adhere for 30 min in the absence ( 2 ) or presence ( 1 )o f1 0 m g/ml mAb KIM-127. The cells were then lysed, the extracts were incubated with C-19 antibody to immunoprecipitate PYK-2 (C-19) or with nonimmune goat serum as a control (NIS), and kinase reactions were performed as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS. PYK-2 levels were determined by immunoprecipitation (IP) with the C-19 anti-PYK-2 antibody and Western blot analysis (WB) with C-19 anti PYK-2 antibody. The position of PYK-2 is indicated with an arrow. The results shown are representative of seven independent experiments. (B) Quantification by densitometric scanning of the ef fect of KIM-127 on PYK-2 activity. PYK-2 was immunoprecipitated with the C-19 antibody and an in vitro kinase reaction carried out as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS. Values are the mean 6 SEM of five independent experiments and are expressed as fold stimulation above control. (C) In vitro kinase reactions of the C-19 PYK-2 immunoprecipitates were performed in the presence of the tyrosine kinase substrate poly-Glu-Tyr (4:1). Phosphorylation of poly-Glu-Tyr (4:1) was carried out after a 15-min incubation with [ g-32 P]ATP as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS. A representative experiment is shown.

(A) Positions of two ends of the MT and of the attached particle are traced. Inset, frame-by-frame analysis of the time at which the particle reaches and leaves the trailing MT end. The 3-s measurement of length of stay (horizontal bar) is detected from the point at which the end of the MT is no longer separately discernable to the point where the end reappears (broken lines). (B) Velocities of the MT and particles calculated using a moving average of three successive measurements of position. The dif ferences between measurements of moving leading and trailing MT ends indicate the measurement error, exaggerated by the moving average. Note that the particle is constantly moving at slightly slower velocity than the MT. The rapid drop of f  of particle velocity beginning at 20 s reflects the time at which the particle leaves the MT end.

p10749924-fig_6_1 Figure 2. Nuclear migration dynamics of diploid cnm67 D cells. Mitotic cell cycles were observed by in vivo time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear positioning of the preanaphase nucleus to the bud neck is usually similar to wild type (e.g., 0 9 , cell A). Unlike in wild type, spindle elongation during anaphase is mostly restricted to the mother cell (e.g., 18 9 , cell A). Elongation of the anaphase spindle usually occurs along the mother-bud axis (e.g., 18 9 , cell A) and is normally followed by a successful nuclear movement into the bud (e.g., 27 9 and 42 9 , cell A). In case of spindle misalignment (192 9 , cell A), the subsequent nuclear migration often fails (201 9-345 9 , cell A) leading to a binucleate cell with an anucleate bud. Nuclear divisions in binucleated cells occur simultaneously (354 9 , cell A, and 498 9 , cell B). After successful transit of a nucleus into the bud, separation can be observed by a change of the position of the bud relative to the mother cell during cytokinesis (e.g., 42 9 and 63 9 , cell A). Anucleate buds (marked with asterisks) are not separated from the mother cell (cell A from 300 9 and cell B from 360 9 ). Bar, 10 m m.

Ommatidia normally have eight photoreceptor cells, each containing a photosensitive rhabdomere. The rhabdomeres of R1-6 are located around the outside of the ommatidium and extend along its entire length ( ; 100 m m). The rhabdomeres of R7 and R8 are located in the center with R7 stacked above R8. Thus, seven rhabdomere profiles are visible in most cross sections.

Note that a few null ommaditia have abnormal or missing photoreceptor cells (arrows). (C) Portion of a Khc null eye clone from a fl y aged 3 w k after eclosion. In addition to the structural defects seen in the photoreceptors of null clones in newly eclosed flies, some photoreceptors have degenerated (arrows).

The cells were then either tested directly for secretion under unstimulated (UNSTIM) or stimulated (STIM) conditions (A) or tested after 3 initial unstimulated hours to further enrich for slow-turnover pools of secretory protein (B). As a consequence, in B, a majority of the remaining intracellular prolactin was exported to the media upon secretagogue exposure. From quantitative scanning of the media and cell lysate bands from each gel (the sum in each case was considered 100%), the percentages recovered in the media under unstimulated (open bars) and stimulated (closed bars) conditions are shown (bar graphs).

Regions of homology are shaded, and the primary sequence identities/similarities shared by individual SFH gene products with Sec14p are given as percentages. (B) Expression of SFH2 , SFH4 , and SFH5 genes rescues the growth defects of sec14 ts and D sec14 yeast mutants. Growth properties of a sec14-1 ts yeast strain (CTY1-1A) carrying YEp( SEC14 ) and YEp( URA3 )  as respective positive and negative controls for phenotypic complementation of the sec14-1 ts growth defect at 37C are as indicated. Growth properties of strain CTY1-1A carrying YEp( SFH2 ), YEp( SFH3 ), YEp( SFH4 ), or YEp( SFH5 ) are also shown. All yeast strains were streaked for isolation onto YPD plates and incubated at either a permissive (25C) or a restrictive (37C) temperature for sec14-1 ts strains, as indicated. After 48 h  of incubation, the growth results were recorded. YEp( SFH2 ) and YEp( SFH4 ) were nearly as ef fective as YEp( SEC14 )  in rescuing growth of the sec14-1 ts strain at 37C. YEp( SFH5 ) was less ef fective, and YEp( SFH3 ) was inef fective. (C) Expression of SFH2 , SFH3 , SFH4 , and SFH5 increases invertase secretion ef ficiency in sec14 ts strains at 37C. Invertase secretion indices (i.e., measures of secretory function) were determined (see MATERIALS AND METHODS). Wild-type strains secrete invertase ef ficiently (secretion index $ 0.90), and Sec14p-insuf ficient cells secrete invertase poorly (secretion index # 0.20). Each YEp( SFH ) expression cassette markedly improved secretory pathway function under conditions of Sec14p deficiency. Values represent averages of at least three independent trials with triplicate determinations for each strain. X. Li et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell 1994

After 48 h, cells were serumstarved  for  3 h and exposed to 100 nM insulin for 30 min. Surface GLUT4myc was detected as described above, and anti-myc surface staining in transfected and untransfected cells from 6-10 fields of view from at least three experiments was quantitated with the use of NIH Image software. A value of 100% was assigned to the insulin response above basal in untransfected cells treated with insulin in each field of view. The pixel intensity of the transfected cells in the same field of view was calculated as a fraction of this value for each experimental condition examined. Shown are the means 6 SE of the insulin response above basal for each experimental condition; p , 0.01 relative to (*) untransfected cells or VAMP-transfected cells.

The APP species that coprecipitated with both WT and asp-mutant PS1 comigrated with the N-glycosylated form of APP detected on straight Western blots of the lysates (lanes 9-11). The lower band in lanes 2-4 and 6-8 is nonspecific. ( b ) Cell lysates were coimmunoprecipitated with PS1 antibodies (combined X81 and 4627, lanes 1, 3, and 5), PS2 antibody 2972 (lane 7), or preimmune serum (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Precipitates were probed by Western blotting with APP antibody 13G8. The C83 and C99 that coprecipitate with PS1 and PS2 are only a small fraction of the C99 and C83 detected by straight Western blotting (WB) of 1 y 20th the amount of the respective cell lysates with 13G8 (lanes 9-11). ( c ) Structure of the difluoro ketone peptidomimetic g-secretase inhibitors, compounds 1 and 11. ( d ) Lysates from WT PS1 cells treated with vehicle alone (DMSO) or the reported g-secretase inhibitor Cpd 11 for 8 h r were coimmunoprecipitated with PS1 antibody R22 (lanes 3 and 5) or preimmune serum (lanes 2 and 4). Precipitates were probed by Western blotting (WB) with APP antibody C7 to detect C83. Small amounts of C99 (which is substantially less abundant than C83) also can be coprecipitated with PS1, but this is very difficult to visualize photographically. Lane 1 shows a straight C7 Western blot of a D257A PS1 cell lysate to indicate the gel positions of C83 and C99. Xia et al . PNAS u August 1, 2000 u vol. 97 u no. 16 u 9301 NEUROBIOLOGY

p10982397-fig_11_1 Figure 5. tER clusters form even when Golgi structures reemerge from the ER. NRK cells were incubated with 5 m g/ml BFA for 1 h ; this treatment caused the complete redistribution of giantin into the ER. Nocodazole was then added to 5 m g/ml, and after 30 min the BFA was washed out in the continued presence of nocodazole. Sec13 and giantin were visualized as in Figure 4. (A) Fifteen minutes after BFA removal, small giantin-containing structures are associated with nearly all of the tER sites. (B) Two hours after BFA removal, large giantin-containing structures are associated with clustered tER sites, but many of the individual tER sites lack adjacent giantin staining. Scale bars represent 10 m m. (C) Quantitation of the localization data, as described in Materials and Methods. The graph shows the percentage of the Sec13 staining that is within 0.3 m m  of a giantin-containing structure at various times after BFA washout in the presence of nocodazole. The bar on the right gives the corresponding value for NRK cells that were treated with nocodazole alone for 2 h . SDs are indicated. Transitional ER Dynamics Vol. 11, September 2000 3023

The stable cell lines cultured with ( 1 )  or without ( 2 ) doxycycline (Dox)  for  3 d were subjected to immunoblot analysis by using antibodies raised against amino acids at the carboxy terminus (anti-A, -COOH, lanes 1-4) or at the amino terminus (anti-A, NH 2 -, lanes 5 and 6) of the myosin II-A heavy chain as well as antibodies raised against the carboxy terminus (anti-B, -COOH, lanes 7 and 8) of the myosin II-B heavy chain. The HeLa Tet-Of f cell line from Clontech does not contain endogenous NMHC II-B (lane 7), but introduction of a plasmid encoding NMHC-B into these cells by stable transfection resulted in NMHC II-B expression in the absence (lane 8), but not in the presence of Dox (lane 7). (B) Immunoblot demonstrating that D N592 does not bind to actin. Purified baculovirus-expressed D N592 does not cosediment with actin in the presence or in the absence of ATP (lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, endogenous NMHC II-A binds to actin in the absence of ATP (lane 5), but not in the presence of ATP (lane 8). P, pellet; S, supernatant. (C) GFPD N592 does not dimerize with endogenous NMHC II-A. Cell extracts from HeLa cells expressing GFPD N592 and endogenous NMHC II-A were incubated with F-actin in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence (lanes 3 and 4) of Mg 2 1-ATP, followed by sedimentation resulting in pellet (p) and supernatant (s) fractions. GFPD N592 does not bind to actin in the absence or presence of ATP (lanes 2 and 4). Endogenous NMHC II-A bound to actin in the absence of ATP (lane 1). Note that only a very small amount of GFPD N592 cosedimented with endogenous NMHC II-A (lane 1). This was most likely due to minor trapping of D N592 in the actin pellet. Q. Wei and R.S.

In A-C, essentially the same results were obtained with three independent cell clones, in which HA-Git2short was induced to be expressed at levels 20-fold higher than that of endogenous Git2-short. We also tried to examine the CA mutant overexpression in the same tetracycline-regulated system, but no cells overexpressed the CA mutant at levels similar to that of the wild-type HA-Git2-short clone. The cell clones we obtained could express the CA mutant up to about threefold higher than the endogenous Git2-short, and no significant changes in the amounts of paxillin-containing focal adhesions and stress fibers were observed (Mazaki and Sabe, unpublished results).

p11447275-fig_3_1 Fig. 2. Localization of actin filaments at different stages of heterocellular collisions between IAR-2 epitheliocytes and RAT-1 fibroblasts. ( A ) Before contact, the epithelial cells (ep) within an island exhibit typical marginal bundles (arrowheads) at their free edge, whereas fibroblasts have numerous bundl es of filaments extending radially into a broad lamella. ( B ) Early stage of heterocellular collision, where the fibroblast has migrated beneath the edge of an epithelial island. Notice the localized disassembly of the marginal bundle in the area of collision and coincident formation of radially oriented small bundles of actin filaments within a small lamellipodial extension at the edge of the epithelial cell (see arrow). ( C )  At later stages of collision fibroblasts retracted the underlapped lamella and turned away from the epithelial edge. The marginal bundles within epithelial cells remain disassembled, and small, actin-rich lamellipodia (ar row) continue to retain contact with the surface of the turned fibroblast. ( D ) When grown in dense cultures numerous fibroblasts align themselves so that their side edge runs along the edge of epithelial islands. Epithelial cells form numerous lamellipodial extensions out onto the surface of the fibroblast (arrows), and th e characteristic marginal bundles are completely disassembled.

The contrast is reversed for convenience. (A-G) The labeling consists of 5to 10-nm silver dots homogeneously distributed within the NOR. It is noticeable that the resolution and contrast are very high at all tilt angles. Moreover, the background is very limited. The crescent-shaped NOR is composed of two coils 180-300 nm wide with a complex shape that appears during tilting. (H) A projection through the full volume of the tomographic reconstruction is observed at 0 angle of view. The high resolution, approximately 10 nm, of this reconstruction is attested by the possibility to discern silver dots within and outside the NOR.

Mutant U3 snoRNAs are stabl e 2 h after injection. 32 P-labeled U3 snoRNA (mutants or wild type) were injected into oocyte nuclei, and the isolated RNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis 2 h after injection. 32 P-labeled U2 snRNA was coinjected as an internal control to normalize for any dif ferences in injection or recovery of the samples. The stability results are from dif ferent experiments for the various mutants, and the amounts of coinjected U3 vs. U2 varied between experiments. For any given mutation, the ratio of U3 to U2 between 0 and 2 h shows that all the mutants are stable at the 2-h time point used for analysis of nucleolar localization, except for the Box C 9 mutant, which has partially degraded relative to the U2 snRNA internal control.
