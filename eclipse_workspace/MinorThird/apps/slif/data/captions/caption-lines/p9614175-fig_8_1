Figure 4. The l phage and plasmids used for transformation rescue and in vivo deletion analysis. (A) Phage l CU-1, l CU-2, l CU-3, and l CU-4 were obtained in the chromosome walk and were used for assaying rescue after transformation. The vertical bars indicate the recognition sites for the enzyme Nhe I. The subclone pCU-1 showed rescue of the Uni 2 phenotype. (B) Southern blots of phenotypically rescued uni3-1 and control strains. Probes g, h, and i were hybridized against DNA from the rescued strains ( 1 ) and control uni3-1 strains ( 2 ). Probes g and h are found in the same Nhe I fragment as probe d  in Figure 3D. Probe i was present in all strains shown as well as 13 other rescued strains. Probes g and h were present in some, but not all, of the rescued strains. The loss of portions of the transforming DNA in rescued strains was used to further delineate the DNA needed for the restoration of the wild-type phenotype to ; 5.5 kb. S.K. Dutcher and E.C.
