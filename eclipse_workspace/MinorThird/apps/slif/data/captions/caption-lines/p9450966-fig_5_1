Figure 2. Comigration of MPP10 translated in vitro and MPP10 from Hela cells. MPP10 transcribed and translated in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine from a full-length cDNA coding sequence and MPP10 from HeLa cells were precipitated with anti-MPP10 serum, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-MPP10 serum. Bound antibodies were detected by ECL (lanes 1 and 2), and radioactive MPP10 was detected by autoradiography (lanes 3 and 4). Positions of migration of molecular mass markers in kDa are indicated on the right; the star indicates the position of migration of IgG heavy chain.
