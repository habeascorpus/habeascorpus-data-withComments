Fig. 1. GABARAP cluster GABA A receptors. This figure shows immunofluorescence of GABA A receptor expressed in QT-6 cells with or without GABARAP. All of the cells shown here expressed a 1 b 2 g 2L GABA A receptor and stained with antibody bd17. ( A ) Large flat cell expressing GABARAP gives clustered GABA receptors. ( B ) Spherical cell with GABARAP gives clusters; note ``broken'' periphery. ( C ) Large flat cell with antisense GABARAP shows diffuse GABA A receptors. ( D and E ) Confocal images of antibody-labeled GABA A receptors ( D , green) and GABARAP ( E , red) at the cell surface. ( F ) A merge of D and E , showing colocalization in yellow. Chen et al .
