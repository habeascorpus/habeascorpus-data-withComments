F IG . 6 . L ocalization of S5. ( A-J ) L ocalization in interphase and in dif ferent st age s  of mitosis. ( Left ) GFP; ( Center ) DNA (PI st ain); ( Right ) merged image of GFP (g reen) and DNA (red). Note the fainter, sec ondar y spots in both interphase ( A ) and early mitosis ( C ), the c ollapse of spindle localization into a single spot at the end of mitosis ( J ) , and the lack of increased S5 f luore scence at spindle pole s. ( K ) Comparison of S5 and spindle pole body localization. ( Left ) GFP; ( Center ) anti-sad1p; ( Right ) merged image of GFP (g reen) and antisad1p st ain ing (red). The t w o signals are distinct.
