paper0005-figures/figure0005-captionContent.txt Representation of the unified role of PARP in the Reg gene transcription and DNA repair. #x03B2 cells are affected by many agents such as immunological abnormalities, virus infections, irradiation, and chemical substances (1, 14#x201318), leading to local inflammation in and#x002For around pancreatic islets. (1) Inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and glucocorticoids are produced in the inflammation process. IL-6#x002Fglucocorticoid stimulation induces the formation of an active transcriptional complex for Reg, a #x03B2-cell regenerating factor gene, in which PARP is involved, and when the PARP is not poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in the presence of PARP inhibitors, the transcriptional complex is stabilized and the Reg gene transcription is maintained. Reg protein then produced in #x03B2 cells acts as an autocrine#x002Fparacrine growth factor on #x03B2 cells via the Reg receptor. DNA replication in #x03B2 cells thus occurs, and the #x03B2-cell regeneration is achieved. (2) DNA-damaging substances such as superoxide (O#x00B72) and nitric oxide (NO#x00B7) are frequently produced in inflammatory processes. When the DNA is damaged, PARP senses DNA nicks and autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ates itself for the DNA repair. Once PARP is autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ated, the formation of the Reg gene transcriptional complex is inhibited, interfering with the interaction between PARP and other nuclear proteins necessary for the active complex; therefore, the transcription of Reg gene stops. (3) When DNA is massively damaged, PARP is rapidly activated to repair the DNA (1, 9#x201313), and the complex for Reg gene transcription is not formed at all.
