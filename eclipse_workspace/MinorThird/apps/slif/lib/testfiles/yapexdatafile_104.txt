<ArticleTitle>Delineation of the <Protname>calcineurin</Protname>-interacting region of <Protname>cyclophilin B</Protname>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (<Protname>CsA</Protname>) inhibits T-cell function by blocking the phosphatase activity of <Protname>calcineurin</Protname>. This effect is mediated by formation of a complex between the drug and <Protname>cyclophilin</Protname> (<Protname>CyP</Protname>), which creates a composite surface able to make high-affinity contacts with <Protname>calcineurin</Protname>. In vitro, the <Protname>CyPB</Protname>/<Protname>CsA</Protname> complex is more effective in inhibiting <Protname>calcineurin</Protname> than the <Protname>CyPA</Protname>/<Protname>CsA</Protname> and <Protname>CyPC</Protname>/<Protname>CsA</Protname> complexes, pointing to fine structural differences in the <Protname>calcineurin</Protname>-binding region. To delineate the <Protname>calcineurin</Protname>-binding region of <Protname>CyPB</Protname>, we mutated several amino acids, located in two loops corresponding to <Protname>CyPA</Protname> regions known to be involved, as follows: R76A, G77H, D155R, and D158R. Compared to wild-type <Protname>CyPB</Protname>, the G77H, D155R, and D158R mutants had intact isomerase and <Protname>CsA</Protname>-binding activities, indicating that no major conformational changes had taken place. When complexed to <Protname>CsA</Protname>, they all displayed only reduced affinity for <Protname>calcineurin</Protname> and much decreased inhibition of <Protname>calcineurin</Protname> phosphatase activity. These results strongly suggest that the three amino acids G77, D155, and D158 are directly involved in the interaction of <Protname>CyPB</Protname>/<Protname>CsA</Protname> with <Protname>calcineurin</Protname>, in agreement with their exposed position. The G77, D155, and D158 residues are not maintained in <Protname>CyPA</Protname> and might therefore account for the higher affinity of the <Protname>CyPB</Protname>/<Protname>CsA</Protname> complex for <Protname>calcineurin</Protname>.</AbstractText>
