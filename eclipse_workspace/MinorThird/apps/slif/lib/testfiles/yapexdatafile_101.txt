<ArticleTitle>Homo-oligomerisation and nuclear localisation of <Protname>mouse histone deacetylase 1</Protname>.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Reversible <Protname>histone</Protname> acetylation changes the chromatin structure and can modulate gene transcription. <Protname>Mammalian histone deacetylase 1</Protname> (<Protname>HDAC1</Protname>) is a nuclear protein that belongs to a growing family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes catalysing the removal of acetyl residues from core histones and other proteins. Previously, we have identified <Protname>murine HDAC1</Protname> as a growth factor-inducible protein in murine T-cells. Here, we characterise the molecular function of <Protname>mouse HDAC1</Protname> in more detail. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with epitope-tagged <Protname>HDAC1 protein</Protname> reveal the association with endogenous <Protname>HDAC1 enzyme</Protname>. We show that <Protname>HDAC1</Protname> can homo-oligomerise and that this interaction is dependent on the N-terminal <Protname>HDAC</Protname> association domain of the protein. Furthermore, the same <Protname>HDAC1</Protname> domain is also necessary for in vitro binding of <Protname>HDAC2</Protname> and <Protname>HDAC3</Protname>, association with <Protname>RbAp48</Protname> and for catalytic activity of the enzyme. A lysine-rich sequence within the carboxy terminus of <Protname>HDAC1</Protname> is crucial for nuclear localisation of the enzyme. We identify a C-terminal nuclear localisation domain, which is sufficient for the transport of <Protname>HDAC1</Protname> and of reporter fusion proteins into the nucleus. Alternatively, <Protname>HDAC1</Protname> can be shuttled into the nucleus by association with another <Protname>HDAC1 molecule</Protname> via its N-terminal <Protname>HDAC</Protname> association domain. Our results define two domains, which are essential for the oligomerisation and nuclear localisation of <Protname>mouse HDAC1</Protname>. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.</AbstractText>
