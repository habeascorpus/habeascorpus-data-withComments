Figure 5. Binding of Cdc42p variants encoded by ef fector-loop mutants to known Cdc42p ef fectors. Plasmids pDLB1305 (Bem1p), pMOSB240 (Ste20p), pDLB1127 (Gic1p), pDLB1238 (WT), pDLB1241 (V36T), pDLB1282 (F37G), or pDLB1243 (Y40K) were used to express recombinant GST-tagged ef fector domains or myc-tagged Cdc42p variants in bacteria. Increasing amounts (twofold increases going from left to right) of lysates containing the myc-tagged Cdc42p variants ( input , top) were incubated with constant (excess) amounts of the indicated GST-ef fectors immobilized on beads, and the amount of myc-Cdc42p remaining bound after washing was determined by immunoblotting.
