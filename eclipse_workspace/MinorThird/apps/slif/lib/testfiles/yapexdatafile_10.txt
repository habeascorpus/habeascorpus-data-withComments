<ArticleTitle>Identification of upstream stimulatory factor as an activator of the human <Protname>dipeptidyl peptidase IV</Protname> gene in Caco-2 cells.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>The 5' upstream region (-448/-443) of the human <Protname>dipeptidyl peptidase IV</Protname> gene promoter containing a consensus E-box (CACGTG) was shown to bind upstream stimulatory factor using nuclear extracts from mouse (3T3) fibroblasts and the human intestinal and hepatic epithelial cell lines Caco-2 and HepG2. Supershift analysis with specific antibodies to <Protname>USF-1</Protname> and <Protname>USF-2</Protname> indicates that <Protname>USF-1</Protname> is the primary isoform binding to the E-box in nuclear extracts from these cells. Using cell culture, transient cotransfection of USF expression vectors with <Protname>dipeptidyl peptidase IV</Protname> promoter constructs revealed that both <Protname>USF-1</Protname> and <Protname>USF-2</Protname> caused an approximately tenfold increase in reporter gene expression in Caco-2 cells. Mutant forms of <Protname>USF-1</Protname> and <Protname>USF-2</Protname> lacking the DNA binding or transcriptional activation domains were unable to stimulate reporter gene expression. Mutation of the E-box prevented binding of USF, although stimulation of reporter gene expression by cotransfection with USF was reduced by only 50%. By using a series of deletion constructs in cotransfection experiments, a second possible site of USF interaction with the <Protname>dipeptidyl peptidase IV</Protname> promoter was localized to the -119/-88 region.</AbstractText>
