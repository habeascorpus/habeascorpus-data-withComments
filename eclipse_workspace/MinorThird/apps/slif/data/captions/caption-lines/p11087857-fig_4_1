Fig. 3. Rlp7p depletion prevents the synthesis of the 25S rRNA. The pGAL1 :: RLP7 strain was depleted of Rlp7p for 17 and 20 h (depleted) and compared with an otherwise isogenic strain, YPH259 (nondepleted). Cells were pulse labeled for 2.5 min with L -[methyl3 H] methionine and then chased for 3 and 12 min with an excess of cold methionine. Total RNA was extracted, and 20,000 cpm per lane was loaded and resolved on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel. Labeled RNAs were transferred to z-probe membrane and visualized by fluorography.
