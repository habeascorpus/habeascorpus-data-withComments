Figure 5. Histochemical staining of tumors derived from pancreata of RIP-Tag2 mice. Cryostat sections of mouse pancreas tumors were reacted with chimeras (0.5 m g/ml) and processed for histochemistry as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS. Original magnification 50 3 in A and 400 3 in B-E. (A) Control fusion protein (E-cadherin IgG) staining of tumor section. The ECM lacks staining. (B) Layilin-IgG stains positively the ECM, and the staining is sensitive to hyaluronidase treatment before incubation with layilin-IgG (C). Similar pretreatment of sections with chondroitinase (D) or heparitinase (E) did not abolish layilin-Fc reactivity. Layilin Is a Hyaluronan Receptor Vol. 12, April 2001 897
