<ArticleTitle>Methylation of <Protname>histone H3</Protname> lysine 9 creates a binding site for <Protname>HP1</Protname> proteins.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText>Distinct modifications of <Protname>histone</Protname> amino termini, such as acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation, have been proposed to underlie a chromatin-based regulatory mechanism that modulates the accessibility of genetic information. In addition to <Protname>histone</Protname> modifications that facilitate gene activity, it is of similar importance to restrict inappropriate gene expression if cellular and developmental programmes are to proceed unperturbed. Here we show that mammalian methyltransferases that selectively methylate <Protname>histone H3</Protname> on lysine 9 (<Protname>Suv39h HMTases</Protname>) generate a binding site for <Protname>HP1</Protname> proteins--a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene silencing and supra-nucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in vitro recognition of a methylated <Protname>histone H3</Protname> peptide by <Protname>HP1</Protname> requires a functional chromo domain; thus, the <Protname>HP1</Protname> chromo domain is a specific interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine9 of <Protname>histone H3</Protname>. In vivo, heterochromatin association of <Protname>HP1</Protname> proteins is lost in <Protname>Suv39h</Protname> double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after the re-introduction of a catalytically active <Protname>SWUV39H1 HMTase</Protname>. Our data define a molecular mechanism through which the <Protname>SUV39H</Protname>-<Protname>HP1</Protname> methylation system can contribute to the propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.</AbstractText>
