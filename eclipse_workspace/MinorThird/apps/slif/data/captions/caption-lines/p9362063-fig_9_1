Figure 5. Tilted views of a silver-stained crescent-shaped NOR. A gallery of seven views taken from a tilted series (from 2 60 to 1 60) of one crescent-shaped silver-stained NOR observed through a 3000-nm-thick section at 300 kV and tilted from 2 60 to 1 60 at a pitch of 2. The contrast is reversed for convenience. (A-G) The labeling consists of 5to 10-nm silver dots homogeneously distributed within the NOR. It is noticeable that the resolution and contrast are very high at all tilt angles. Moreover, the background is very limited. The crescent-shaped NOR is composed of two coils 180-300 nm wide with a complex shape that appears during tilting. (H) A projection through the full volume of the tomographic reconstruction is observed at 0 angle of view. The high resolution, approximately 10 nm, of this reconstruction is attested by the possibility to discern silver dots within and outside the NOR. (Compare with initial images of the tilted series in A-G). Bar, 500 nm. Electron Tomography of Metaphase NORs Vol. 8, November 1997 2207
