Fig. 4. Microinjection experiments with C2 ( A and B ) and C3 ( C and D ). The injection of C2 and C3 cause the rapid disassembly of actin stress fibers stained with TRITC-phalloidin ( B and D ). The Man II-stained Golgi complex ( A and C ) collapses in the presence of C2 ( A ) but not of C3 ( C ). Small white arrows indicate the microinjected cells. (Bar 5 10 m m.)
