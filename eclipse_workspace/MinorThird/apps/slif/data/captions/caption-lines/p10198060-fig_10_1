Figure 7. Ef fect of nonpolymerizable IAA-tubulins and a-tubulin fragments and peptides on binding of kinesin to MTs. The kinesin head (K394) was incubated with MTs in the absence or presence of IAA-HeLa Glu or IAA-HeLa Tyr tubulin (A), a-tubulin fragments (B; a-C, a-N, and a-C Glu), or C-terminal peptides of a-tubulin (B), was pelleted by centrifugation, and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Pellet and supernatant (Spt) fractions are shown in A, whereas only pellet fractions are shown in B. Bands marked T and K are tubulin and the kinesin head K394, respectively. Note, in A, that little kinesin head is detected in the MT pellet in the sample incubated with IAA-HeLa Glu tubulin (kinesin head is instead recovered in the supernatant), but significant kinesin head is recovered in MT pellets in the sample incubated with IAA-HeLa Tyr tubulin. The additional tubulin recovered in the supernatants in the IAA-HeLa Glu and Tyr tubulin samples reflects the added nonpolymerizable tubulin. Con, control. G. Kreitzer et al .
