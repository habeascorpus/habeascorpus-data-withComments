Figure 3. Rpl11b-GFP localization assay. Wild-type (PSY580) or mtr4-1 cells expressing Rpl11b-GFP from a CEN plasmid were grown to early log phase, shifted to 37C for 1 h , and then shifted back to 25C for up to 1 h . Yeast cells were fixed and incubated with DAPI to stain the nuclei. Rpl11b-GFP was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Panels a, b, e, and f show cells shifted to 37C for 1 h , and panels c, d, g, and h show cells shifted back to 25C for 30 min. T. Stage-Zimmermann et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell 3782
