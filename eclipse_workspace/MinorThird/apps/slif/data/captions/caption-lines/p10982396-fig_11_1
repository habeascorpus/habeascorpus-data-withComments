Figure 8. Tail retraction is inhibited in cells devoid of microtubules. (A) Migration of a melb-a melanoblast after stimulation with SCF. Cell form lamellipodia and advance quickly (arrowhead). (B) In contrast cells treated with nocodazole prior to SCF form lamellipodia but are inhibited in cell migration. The depicted cell advances very slowly and leaves a trace of membrane behind, indicating inhibition of tail retraction (arrowhead). Actin-dependent Lamellipodia Formation Vol. 11, September 2000 3009
