F IG . 6 . Underdominant rRNA gene s suppre ssed in veget ative tissue s are ex pre ssed in f loral tissue s  of B. napus . Veget ative leave s, cauline leave s, f loral buds, sepals, pet als, anthers, and silique s f rom a single mature B. napus plant were har ve sted on the same day. A n equal amount of tot al RNA f rom each t ype of organ was subjected to S1 nuclease protection analysis using probe s specific for B. rapa (lane s 3-10) or B. oleracea (lane s 11-18) rRNA transcripts, as in Fig. 4. RNA f rom diploid B. rapa or B. oleracea ser ved as c ontrols (lane s 3 and 11) and show that the t w o probe s were similar in specific activ it y. Note that B. oleracea gene s are readily detected in all organs derived f rom the f loral meristem (lane s 1 4-18) but are not detected in veget ative leave s or cauline leave s (lane s 1 2 and 13). DNA sequencing reaction products ser ved as size markers in lane s 1 and 2. 3446 Plant Biolog y: Chen and Pik aard P roc. Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 (1997)
