Figure 2. Immunolocalization of PLD1 in rat NRK cells. Cells were stained with rabbit antibodies directed against PLD1 peptides P1-P4 (A and D). These cells were costained with either mAbs 53FC3 directed against mannosidase II (B) or GM130 (E). C and F show the overlaping regions between PLD1 and the Golgi marker proteins. (G) Cells were also stained with an independently generated rabbit antibody to the C-terminal of PLD1 (MATERIALS AND METHODS). (H) Preincubation of the P1-P4 antibody with 1.3 m g  of antigenic peptide before immunolocalization; (I) corresponding phase-contrast image. Images are from projected Z-series. Bar, 10 m m.
