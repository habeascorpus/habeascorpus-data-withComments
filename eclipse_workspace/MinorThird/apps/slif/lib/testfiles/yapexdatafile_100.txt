<ArticleTitle><Protname>LDL-receptor-related protein 6</Protname> is a receptor for Dickkopf proteins.</ArticleTitle>
<AbstractText><Protname>Wnt glycoproteins</Protname> have been implicated in diverse processes during embryonic patterning in metazoa. They signal through frizzled-type seven-transmembrane-domain receptors to stabilize <Protname>beta-catenin</Protname>. <Protname>Wnt</Protname> signalling is antagonized by the extracellular <Protname>Wnt</Protname> inhibitor <Protname>dickkopf1</Protname> (<Protname>dkk1</Protname>), which is a member of a multigene family. <Protname>dkk1</Protname> was initially identified as a head inducer in Xenopus embryos but the mechanism by which it blocks <Protname>Wnt</Protname> signalling is unknown. <Protname>LDL-receptor-related protein 6</Protname> (<Protname>LRP6</Protname>) is required during <Protname>Wnt</Protname>/<Protname>beta-catenin</Protname> signalling in Drosophila, Xenopus and mouse, possibly acting as a co-receptor for <Protname>Wnt</Protname>. Here we show that <Protname>LRP6</Protname> (ref. 7) is a specific, high-affinity receptor for <Protname>Dkk1</Protname> and <Protname>Dkk2</Protname>. <Protname>Dkk1</Protname> blocks <Protname>LRP6</Protname>-mediated <Protname>Wnt</Protname>/<Protname>beta-catenin</Protname> signalling by interacting with domains that are distinct from those required for <Protname>Wnt</Protname>/<Protname>Frizzled</Protname> interaction. <Protname>dkk1</Protname> and <Protname>LRP6</Protname> interact antagonistically during embryonic head induction in Xenopus where <Protname>LRP6</Protname> promotes the posteriorizing role of <Protname>Wnt</Protname>/<Protname>beta-catenin</Protname> signalling. Thus, DKKs inhibit <Protname>Wnt</Protname> co-receptor function, exemplifying the modulation of LRP signalling by antagonists.</AbstractText>
