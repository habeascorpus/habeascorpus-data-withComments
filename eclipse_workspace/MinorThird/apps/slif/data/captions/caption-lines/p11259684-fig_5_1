Fig. 4. Visualization of focal contacts and associated structures in v-src-transformed b 1A-GD25 or mutant b 1A cells on fibronectin-coated substrata. ( A ) Single immunofluorescent detection of b 1A. ( B ) Double immunofluorescent detection of vinculin (green) and rhodamine-phalloidin (red) . b 1A-GD25, GD25 cells expressing wild-type b 1A; other cells are designated by mutation(s). Microscopic analysis of multiple cells in multiple fields indicated the b 1and vinculincontaining focal contacts were present in . 40% of transformed Y783F and Y783 y 795F cells but in , 5% of b 1A cells and , 20% of Y795F cells.
