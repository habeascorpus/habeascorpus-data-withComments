Static Index Pruning Tools
<p>
This package provides a framework for pruning an existing index into 
a smaller index while retaining visible search quality as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
An index can be pruned in several levels:
<ol>
  <li>Remove stored data: see <a href="./StorePruningPolicy.html">StorePruningPolicy</a></li>
  <li>Remove terms data: see <a href="./TermPruningPolicy.html">TermPruningPolicy</a></li>
</ol>
Pruning can be applied programmatically via a <a href="../PruningReader.html">PruningReader</a>
or with the static tool <a href="./PruningTool.html">PruningTool</a>.
