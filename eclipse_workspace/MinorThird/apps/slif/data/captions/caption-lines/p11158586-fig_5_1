Fig. 6. Effect of cycloheximide on the nucleolar accumulation of PML and proteasomes. ( A ) MCF-7 cells that were treated with MG132 alone ( a and b ) or with MG132 plus cycloheximide ( c and d ) over night did not change the nucleolar accumulation of PML (green). ( B ) The nucleolar accumulation of proteasomes (green) was not altered by the inhibition of protein synthesis in MCF-7 cells ( a-d ). DNA staining in blue. 1016 u www.pnas.org Mattsson et al.
