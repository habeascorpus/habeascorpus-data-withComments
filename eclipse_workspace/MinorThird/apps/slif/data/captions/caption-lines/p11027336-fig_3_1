Fig. 1. p50 protein associates with the C terminus of WRN in vitro. ( A ) Yeast two-hybrid screening. The WRNCT bait encoding amino acids 949-1401 ( ; 50 kDa) of the human WRN protein was cloned into pAS2-1 vector and used to screen a human placental cDNA library. The schematic representation of the WRNCT bait shows the C terminus nuclear localization signal (NLS), the conserved RecQ domain (RecQCt), and the putative nucleic acid binding domain (HRD). ( B ) Retransformation of the yeast expression plasmids to Y190 host strain. pAS2-1, bait vector alone; p50, full-length p50 in pACT2 vector in fusion with GAL4-activator domain. pLAM and pVA3 are human lamin C and murine p53, respectively, cloned into the pAS2-1 vector. ( C ) In vitro translation combined with immunoprecipitation. WRNCT and full-length p50 cloned into pcDNA3.1-His y Xpress and pcDNA 3.1-His y Myc vectors, respectively, were transcribed y translated in vitro in the presence (WRNCT) or absence (p50) of [ 35 S]methionine. Equal amounts of labeled WRNCT polypeptide were mixed with either control (lanes 1 and 3) or p50-Myc programmed nonradioactive reticulocyte lysates (lanes 2 and 4) and immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc (lanes 1 and 2) or anti-HA (lanes 3 and 4) polyclonal antibodies. The associated polypeptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The lower panel indicates 2.5% of the corresponding mixtures loaded before immunoprecipitation (input). We estimated that 4-5% of the input protein could be coprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody used.
