Figure 3. Nucleolar localization of U6 snRN A 4 h after injection into oocyte nuclei. The nucleolar localization of U3 snoRNA, U6 snRNA, U2 snRNA, and a 40-nt control RNA was analyze d 4 h after injection into oocyte nuclei. U3 snoRNA, as a positive control (see Lange et al. , 1998c), stains nucleoli strongly. U6 snRNA, either with a stabilizing 5 9 cap (U6) or without a cap (U6 2 ), shows moderate nucleolar localization. Nucleolar signals are weak for U2 snRNA and at background levels for the control RNA. Cajal bodies (Gall et al. , 1999) are indicated by arrows in some phase contrast panels and reveal moderate staining by U6 and U2. A lampbrush chromosome is visible in the U3 preparation (see PC and DAPI panels). Other details as in Figure 1. T.S.Lange and S.A. Gerbi Molecular Biology of the Cell 2424
