F IG . 6 . Specific disr uption of f rog ooc y t e pre-rRNA proce ssing induced by E3 RNA deg radation and reversed by E3 RNA. The ex periments were done as indicated in Fig. 4. Af ter injections of oligonucleotide s and [ a-32 P]GT P, ooc y t e s were incubated for 16 ( A and C )o r8( B ) h . The ooc y t e s in A show both pre-rRNA proce ssing pathways A and B. The ooc y t e s in B and C have only pre-rRNA proce ssing pathway A.
