Figure 6. The targeting and processing of lysosomal enzymes are normal in lmpA and pI/II 2 null cells; secretion of lysosomal a-mannosidase is reduced in lmpA null cells. Wild-type, profilin-null, and LIMPnull strains growing in HL5 medium were pulse labeled with [ 35 S]methionine for 20 min and chased in nonradioactive fresh medium. (A-C) At the times indicated, cells were harvested and a-mannosidase was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and supernatants and subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Cells in growth medium were also harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh medium. (D) At the times indicated, samples were collected and the levels of a-mannosidase activity were measured in wild-type cells ( f ) and lmpA null cells ( F ) and extracellular medium. L.
