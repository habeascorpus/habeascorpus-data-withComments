Fig. 1. RhoB is dispensable for arrest response of primary cells after DNA damage. ( A ) PCR genotyping. Genotypes were determined by multiplex PCR for rhoB or neo transgene sequences as described (14). Products were fractionated on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. ( B ) Flow cytometry. Primary MEFs (passage 3) were subjected to treatment with 1,000 ng y ml doxorubicin (Dox) or a 20-Gy dose of gamma irradiation and processed for flow cytometry 24 h  or 3 6 h later, respectively. MEFs prepared from different embryos responded similarly. Liu et al. PNAS u May 22, 2001 u vol. 98 u no. 11 u 6193 CELL BIOLOGY
