/* * XSLTC compile-time error messages. * * General notes to translators and definitions: * * 1) XSLTC is the name of the product. It is an acronym for "XSLT Compiler". * XSLT is an acronym for "XML Stylesheet Language: Transformations". * * 2) A stylesheet is a description of how to transform an input XML document * into a resultant XML document (or HTML document or text). The * stylesheet itself is described in the form of an XML document. * * 3) A template is a component of a stylesheet that is used to match a * particular portion of an input document and specifies the form of the * corresponding portion of the output document. * * 4) An axis is a particular "dimension" in a tree representation of an XML * document; the nodes in the tree are divided along different axes. * Traversing the "child" axis, for instance, means that the program * would visit each child of a particular node; traversing the "descendant" * axis means that the program would visit the child nodes of a particular * node, their children, and so on until the leaf nodes of the tree are * reached. * * 5) An iterator is an object that traverses nodes in a tree along a * particular axis, one at a time. * * 6) An element is a mark-up tag in an XML document; an attribute is a * modifier on the tag. For example, in <elem attr='val' attr2='val2'> * "elem" is an element name, "attr" and "attr2" are attribute names with * the values "val" and "val2", respectively. * * 7) A namespace declaration is a special attribute that is used to associate * a prefix with a URI (the namespace). The meanings of element names and * attribute names that use that prefix are defined with respect to that * namespace. * * 8) DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model. It is a tree * representation of an XML document. * * SAX is an acronym for the Simple API for XML processing. It is an API * used inform an XML processor (in this case XSLTC) of the structure and * content of an XML document. * * Input to the stylesheet processor can come from an XML parser in the * form of a DOM tree or through the SAX API. * * 9) DTD is a document type declaration. It is a way of specifying the * grammar for an XML file, the names and types of elements, attributes, * etc. * * 10) XPath is a specification that describes a notation for identifying * nodes in a tree-structured representation of an XML document. An * instance of that notation is referred to as an XPath expression. * * 11) Translet is an invented term that refers to the class file that contains * the compiled form of a stylesheet. */	TokenNameCOMMENT_BLOCK	 XSLTC compile-time error messages. * General notes to translators and definitions: * 1) XSLTC is the name of the product.
