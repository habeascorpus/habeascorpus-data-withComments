Figure 4. Some of the stable and brightly labeled microtubule segments that are tethered to a chromosome by labile elongations undergo depolymerization-coupled movement toward the chromosome. Arrows indicate the location of the brightly labeled microtubule segments. Times are indicated in seconds. The top left panel in each series shows a chromosome visualized by DAPI fluorescence. The other panels are visualized by fluorescence of rhodamine-labeled tubulin. (A) In the top center and top right panels the kinetochores are visualized as described for Figure 2B. The microtubule indicated by the arrow in the top right panel swivels dif fusively about its attachment to the chromosome so it projects more vertically in the bottom panels. (B) Another example of depolymerization-coupled movement. Bars, 5 m m. A.J. Hunt and J.R. McIntosh Molecular Biology of the Cell 2864
