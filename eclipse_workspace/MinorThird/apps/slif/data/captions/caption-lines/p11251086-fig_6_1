Figure 3. Development of the male gametophyte of M. vestita in normal medium, or in medium containing either a-amanitin or cycloheximide. Cells were fixed at various times after imbibition. (a) Untreated gametophyte fixed after the 3rd cell division, 90 min after imbibition. Each of the antheridial initials has already produced the 1st of 3 sterile jacket cells, which are rich in plastids. (b) Untreated gametophyte fixed after the 9th cell division , 5 h after imbibition. This 2 m m section depicts 14 of the 32 spermatids. The jacket cells are becoming less conspicuous. (c) Untreated gametophyte fixed  at 8 h after imbibition. The spermatids had initiated nuclear elongation at the time of fixation. (d) A gametophyte incubated with a-amanitin at the time of imbibition and fixe d 4 h later. (e) A gametophyte incubated with a-amanitin at the time of imbibition and fixed 8 h later. All of the mitotic division cycles have occurred in these gametophytes. (f) A gametophyte incubated with cycloheximide at the time of imbibition and fixed 10 h later. There have been no cell divisions. Moreover, there have been no apparent changes in cytoplasmic or nuclear organization in the presence of this inhibitor. All images photographed with DIC.
