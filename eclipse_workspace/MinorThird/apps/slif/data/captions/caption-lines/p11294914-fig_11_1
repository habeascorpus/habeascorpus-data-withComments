Figure 8. Dependence of complementation of null and ts mutants on the af finity of profilin mutants for actin and polyl-proline. Reduced af finities within 10-fold of wild-type profilin ( . 0.1 WT) are tolerated both in profilin null and ts background; loss of af finities between 10and 50-fold ( . 0.02 WT) are able to rescue the ts allele but not the null; . 100-fold loss of af finities ( , 0.01 WT) are incompatible with life. Altered nucleotide exchange activity of actin binding mutants also determined their complementing ability.  ?  indicates no mutants to test in these categories in the group with af finity . 0.02 WT.
