Figure 1. Generation and visualization of newly formed SGs. PC12 cells transfected with hCgB-GFP(S65T) were plated onto coverslips. Cells were incubated  for 2h at 20C (temperature block) and either fixed (A-C) or incubated additionally for 30 min at 37C (chase) and then fixed (D-F). After fixation, cells were immunostained for TGN38 protein and analyzed by confocal double fluorescence microscopy. Forty confocal sections per cell were taken and superimposed. (A and D) GFP-fluorescence. (B and E) TGN38 immunofluorescence. (C) Overlay of A (green) and B (red). (F) Overlay of D (green) and E (red). Yellow indicates colocalization of TGN38 and GFP-fluorescence. Asterisks mark TGN38 staining of cells that do not express hCgBGFP. Bars, 5 m m. R. Rudolf et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1356
