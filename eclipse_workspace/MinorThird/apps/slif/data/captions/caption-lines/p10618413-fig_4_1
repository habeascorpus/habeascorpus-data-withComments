Fig. 4. Anaphase bridges containing centromeres and chromosome 11. Immunolabeling with Abs to tubulin (yellow), centromeres (red), and with DAPI (blue) and FISH with a chromosome 11 paint probe (green). ( B ) Arrows point to centromeres trapped in the forming midbody as these late telophase cells divide. ( D ) Arrow points to the trapped lagging chromosome excluded from the reforming nucleus of the cell on the right. ( E ) Some micronuclei are immunonegative for anti-centromere Abs. Arrow points to negative micronucleus, and arrowhead points to positive. Examples are from UPCI:SCC131. 306 u www.pnas.org Saunders et al.
