"Evaluating Engineering Education:  A Stakeholder-Driven, Outcomes-Based
Approach"

<paragraph>        <sentence>Accreditation, the only evaluative technique consistently used in most
engineering schools today, provides a measure of the resources the
institution has to offer and the educational procedures it follows, but
it does not provide any real measure of the educational outcomes of the
engineering programs</sentence>.  <sentence>This paper proposes a flexible, quantitative
methodology for setting evaluation criteria which can be used to
determine how well engineering institutions prepare their graduates for
the working world</sentence>.</paragraph>
<paragraph>        <sentence>Survey, decision-analytic and concordancee analytic techniques are
combined to develop a set of ~politically optimal,~ weighted educational
outcomes, indicating a specified industry~s needs regarding the
qualifications of their entry-level engineers</sentence>.  <sentence>The proposed methodology
is illustrated through the development of educational evaluation
criteria based on the needs of the international construction industry</sentence>.</paragraph>
