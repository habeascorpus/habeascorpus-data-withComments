Figure 3. EPT1 and di8:0 diacylglycerol af fect SEC14-mediated cell growth. (A) CTY434 yeast ( sec14 ts cpt1::LEU2 EPT1 ) transformed with CPT1 or EPT1 in the high copy number YEp352 vector, or YPP649.7 ( sec7 ts ), YPP649.13 ( sec13 ts ), and YPP649.15 ( sec15 ts ) transformed with YEp352 were grown overnight at 25C in appropriate selective medium to ensure plasmid maintenance and diluted to identical cell number as determined spectrophotometrically by culture absorbance at 600 nm. Serial dilutions (1:10) were performed, and 1 m l of each dilution was plated onto SC minus uracil plates. (B) The identical experiment except 1 m l  of each dilution was plated onto SC minus uracil plates containing 200 m M di8:0 diacylglycerol. All plates were incubated for 4 d  at 25C o r7d at 37C. [CPT1] and [EPT1] indicate the presence of YEp352 plasmid-borne genes. Lipid Synthesis and Vesicle Traf ficking Vol. 12, March 2001 515
