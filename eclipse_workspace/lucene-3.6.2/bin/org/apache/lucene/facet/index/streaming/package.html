<h1>Expert: attributes streaming definition for indexing facets</h1>

Steaming of facets attributes is a low level indexing interface with Lucene indexing.
There are two types of category related streams:
<ul>
  <li><b>Category tokenizer stream</b> handles tokenization for a single category, 
  e.g. for creating drill-down tokens.</li>
  <li><b>Category list tokenizer stream</b> handles tokenization for multiple categories, 
  e.g. for creating a counting list token, representing all the categories of 
  a certain document.</li>
</ul>
