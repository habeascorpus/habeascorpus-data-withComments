Fig. 6. In vivo reconstitution of SLP-76 restores platelet function in SLP-76 2 / 2 mice. ( A ) Platelets were isolated from the nonmanipulated RAG2 2 / 2 mice or retrovirally reconstituted mice and left either untreated or stimulated with thrombin or convulxin for 10 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry for P-selectin expression. For the bone marrow reconstituted mice, gates were set to analyze only GFP-positive (transduced) cells. Similar results were seen in three independent experiments. ( B ) Platelets from nonmanipulated RAG2 2 / 2 mice or mice reconstituted with manipulated bone marrow were incubated for 45 min on fibrinogen-coated coverslips in the absence ( a , d , and g )  or presence of 0.5 unit y ml thrombin ( b , e , and h ), or 30 m g y ml collagen ( c , f , and i ). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained for phosphotyrosine (blue) and F-actin (red). Each field with platelets from manipulated mice contains a mixture of GFP-positive (transduced) and GFP-negative (nontransduced) platelets. Arrows indicate GFPpositive cells. Platelets from nonmanipulated RAG2 2 / 2 mice are shown in a-c , and d-f show platelets from a RAG2 2 / 2 mouse reconstituted with SLP-76 2 / 2 bone marrow expressing SLP-76 and GFP. ( g-i ) Platelets from a RAG2 2 / 2 mouse reconstituted with SLP-76 2 / 2 bone marrow expressing GFP. All panels are the same magnification. (Bar 5 10 m m.) 12060 u www.pnas.org Judd et al.
