Figure 7. Colocalization of the [PRR 1 CRR]-GFP with Golgi markers and treatment with brefeldin A. COS cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA for the [PRR 1 CRR]- GFP construct (Table 2). Two days after transfection, the cells were either fixed and prepared for immunohistochemistry with the anti-58-kDa antibody (a and b) or incubated with BODIPY TR ceramide (c-f) and brefeldin A ( e and f) to label and disrupt, respectively, Golgi membranes. Cells were observed with fluorescence microscopy with the use of a FITC filter for detection of GFP (a, c, and e), a rhodamine filter for detection of the Cy3-labeled secondary antibody (b), or a Texas Red filter for detection of BODIPY TR ceramide (d and f).
