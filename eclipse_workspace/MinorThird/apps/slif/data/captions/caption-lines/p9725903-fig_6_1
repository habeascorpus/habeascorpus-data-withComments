Figure 3. The 5 9-ETS leader pre-rRNA is not found in the NDF of CMT3 cells. The 5 9-ETS leader pre-rRNA was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization using an antisense biotinylated riboprobe (nucleotides 1 195/ 1 424). (A-C) Interphase cells labeled with the 5 9-ETS probe and anti-B23 antibody. In the nucleoli of these cells the 5 9-ETS leader is localized to a restricted area (A) compared with the region labeled with anti-B23 antibody (B), which is clearly shown on the overlay (C). (E-G) Early prophase cells. In these cells the 5 9-ETS leader segment is detectable in restricted areas in the disintegrating nucleoli in early (E) compared with protein B23 labeling (F) in the superimposed picture (G). (D and H) Anaphase cells colabeled with the 5 9-ETS leader probe and anti-B23 antibody. In these cells the signal from the 5 9-ETS leader was reduced to background levels (D) but showing the presence of protein B23 in the perichromosomal region and in NDF (H, small arrows). (I-K) Late telophase cells colabeled with the 5 9-ETS leader probe and anti-B23 antibody. The 5 9-ETS leader was detected only in postmitotic transcriptionally reactivated nucleoli (I, arrowheads) where it colocalized with protein B23 (J, arrowheads; K, yellow in superimposed picture).
