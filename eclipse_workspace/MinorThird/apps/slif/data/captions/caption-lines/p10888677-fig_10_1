Figure 7. Tetanus toxin inhibits insulin-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation in L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts. (A) Intact L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts under basal (left) or insulin-stimulated (right) conditions were processed for indirect surface immunofluorescence with anti-myc IgG. Bar, 5 m m. (B) L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts were transfected with 0.6 m g  of wildtype or toxin-resistant (VW) V2-GFP or V3-GFP cDNA in conjunction with 0.9 m g  of pcDNA3 (open bars) or TeTx cDNA (closed bars) as indicated. After 48 h, cells were serumstarved  for  3 h and exposed to 100 nM insulin for 30 min. Surface GLUT4myc was detected as described above, and anti-myc surface staining in transfected and untransfected cells from 6-10 fields of view from at least three experiments was quantitated with the use of NIH Image software. A value of 100% was assigned to the insulin response above basal in untransfected cells treated with insulin in each field of view. The pixel intensity of the transfected cells in the same field of view was calculated as a fraction of this value for each experimental condition examined. Shown are the means 6 SE of the insulin response above basal for each experimental condition; p , 0.01 relative to (*) untransfected cells or VAMP-transfected cells. Insulin caused an approximately twofold increase in surface GLUT4myc levels above basal in untransfected cells. V.K. Randhawa et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell 2412
